# Test MDX File

This is a test MDX file to verify that our MDX setup is working correctly.

- **Frontmatter**: YAML frontmatter is parsed
- **Components**: Ready for React components

## Code Example

```javascript
console.log('Hello from MDX!');
```

Once this renders correctly, we can add more complex MDX features like:
- Import statements
- React components
- Interactive elements
