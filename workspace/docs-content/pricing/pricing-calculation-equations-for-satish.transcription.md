So I need to explain formula equations for my front end developer to transform or implement the pricing calculator page that we have created.

So I'm going to give you a detailed description of how we are going to bill our customers. So we are a B to B, subscription based monthly or yearly service for the software developers, so an organization with developers can get a subscription of ours, and they will have to purchase seats for their developers. So we only have one. So we have two plans that will help us make money. We actually have three different plans. And the first is free. Second is Team third is custom plan or enterprise. And for a free plan, the price per seat is $0 for team plan, the price per seat is $9 if it is a annual subscription, so they have to pay the total seed subscription price upfront for the year, and any new seats added at a later point, they will be charged on a pro rated basis for the rest of the year. And

both free plan and team plan have usage based components. So first I'll talk about the simpler usage based components. One of them is co pilot messages. So each of these usage based plans have free portions included. So in in the free plan, 50 co pilot messages are included. And the price per minute per message after that, 50 is $0.02 and for automation runner minutes, sorry, and for yearly sorry team subscription, the messages included is 500 so it is 10 times more, and the price per message after that will not change. It is still 0.0 $2

so it's pretty straightforward, right? Usage based how the total number of co pilot messages that get accumulated or during the course of the month multiplied by minus the messages already included, but depending on their subscription. So if it is scheme, then we subscribe. If it is less than 500 messages, there is no charge additional charge because it's already within the limit. So we do total COVID messages, minus the included messages based on subscription, if the if it is positive number, meaning if the total usage used messages is more than the included then we charge, charge the customer on on the basis of 0.0 $2 per message after that, and for free, the only difference is that included messages are 50, and another usage based component is automation runner minutes. In this one, the free plan includes 100 automation runner minutes, and after that it is 0.0 $8 per minute, okay, and the team subscription has 1000 minutes included, and price per minute is still same, 0.0 $8

and it's the calculation sees exactly same as the co pilot messages and

for IAC resources. This is the third usage based component, and this is kind of slightly tricky. This one is inspired from pulumi. Pulumi on IAC resource modeling. So basically, when developers deploy infrastructure, those deployments will result in pulumi or TerraForm resources. So think of like if any case cluster is deployed, then there will be several AWS resources, whether it is TerraForm or pulumi that are created. So the way we charge them is same way as pulumi Cloud charges its customers, which is based on resource hours. So pulumi has this concept of pulumi credits. Each credit is then is equal to one hour of an a pulumi resource in the back end state. So say, for example, for one hour an Eks cluster is created, and it resulted in creating 50 pulumi resources. And if the Eks cluster is kept for 10 hours, then 50 into 10 hours is equal to 500 pulumi credits, because it is 500 hours, right? And pulumi includes 150 K free credits. And in our case, we, instead of saying credits, we are calling it as resource hours, so but the concepts are exactly same, and in in free subscription, we, we we are saying

the resources included are 200 it's actually not the resources included. We are basically saying the equivalent resource hours are included. But for to keep it simple for the users, we are saying 200 IAC resources are included, which is equivalent to 150 K resource hours. So we include, provide 150 K resource hours, so that is a hard coded number, and at the end of the month, we calculate the total number of IAC resource hours, and if it is free plan, then we charge the user for

a total number of IEC resource hours up until that point, minus 150 K resource hours. And for additional resource hour, we charge 0.0001 dollars. That is 0.0001 dollars per hour. So for a team plan, we include 2000 resources, which comes to 1.5 million resource hours. So for example, if a customer has total 3000 IAC resources, then that means we calculate 3000 into 24, hours, sorry, 3000 resource hours.

let's assume that the customer has 3000 resources, but we calculate behind the scenes, we calculate resource hours because they get accumulated over time. For example, if the same Eks cluster is destroyed after 10 hours, then in the 11th hour, there will be zero resources making the cumulative count to remain at 500 so unless that another Eks cluster, or rather stack, is executed, the total number continues to remain at 500 until the end of the month. So that is 500 resource hours, but because there is already 150 K resource hours already included. We don't charge anything to the user. So this is a complex use case. So give the pricing calculation in a nice way that the web developer can understand and write the formulas on the web front end code. So also include examples for all of these. by plan and by subscription.
