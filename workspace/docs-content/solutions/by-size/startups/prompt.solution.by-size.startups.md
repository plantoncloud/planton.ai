I've been working on creating content for our new sales website, and our workflow is to for me as a product owner, to
clearly provide the various sections of each page on the sales website along with the site map of the number of pages,
etc, to our figma UX designer, I have done that for several pages until now, and now I'm working on providing those
section by section titles along with descriptions and any visual help. So the structure of the pages is hero section
follow the page sections, with each section having a title and a description and some kind of visualization, either a
video or a GIF or a image. So I would need your help on identifying the visual help for such pages. Right now we are
working on creating content for solution pages. So these pages are expected to repurpose the same information around the
product by aligning that information to a particular solution. So solutions are divided by role, company size and use
cases. If we take the example of solution from a company size perspective, we are going to provide content on on a
company size, say, startup, of what are those key elements that startups would really look for in a solution like plant
or not AI, and how can they benefit from using plant control as a solution for those problems? And we repeat this
process, or we apply the same logic for creating by coming up with content for all solution pages, it's these are not
feature pages. Feature pages are more about highlighting the features within the platform, regardless of who is looking
at it, whereas solution pages are more tailored towards aligning the content based on the visitor of that particular
page. So if somebody has opened startup solution page that means they are the visitor is either part of a startup or a
founder of a startup, etc. So this is what we are going to work together right now, I'm also sharing you the overall,
larger goal details, along with certain guidelines on how the structure should be aligned that can give you an idea of
how the rest of the pages have been created thus far. Along with those standard guidelines, I'm also going to give you
all the other pages that we have finalized so far, so that you have a pretty good idea of what the product is all about.
And at the end of all of this, I'm going to share a transcription that I recorded for explaining our product from that
solution perspective. Now, with all of this information, you are going to give me three options for the hero section, 10
page sections and a Call to Action section at the end. So

NOTE: DO NOT NUMBER PAGE-SECTIONS in your response

## FOCUS OF THIS REQUEST - Solutions - By Size - Startups

Most importantly put yourself in the role of a highly skilled developer tooling sales messaging creation expert for this
task.

-- transcriptions for startups

All right, so the primary goal of this discussion between me and my friend is to discuss how plant on Cloud can offer
several benefits to startups so that we can present all of that information on the new sales website that we are
creating in the solution section, where we are going to dedicate a full page to explain all these various features or
value propositions that we are offering from the perspective of startups. How can startups benefit? So I would like to
think that plant on Cloud as a product has so much to offer for any startup, because plantem cloud itself is a startup,
so we use this product every day. And what do we what are those key aspects of plant on cloud that makes the journey of
this startup much more easier is, I think the journey would begin with the fact that startups usually have smaller
teams, so and they have smaller budgets to operate. So it is important for startups to leverage rely on as much
automation as possible to save money. And also startups from first any startup time is very valuable, so they want to go
to market as quickly as possible. So like for example, there is GitHub for to enable startups to store their source code
for all their applications without GitHub, then it becomes very difficult for startups to collaborate on source code
between the small team that they have right so similarly, we wanted to always build a tool that is As simple as GitHub
to use, but for DevOps operations. So what does it really mean for startups in terms of their reliance on DevOps? So
let's imagine you're building any mobile app which typically has a few microservices, or even if you're talking about
simple monolith applications, you still have a code repository that is, that contains the source code for your software,
and it needs to be deployed onto servers, so without the help or expertise from a DevOps engineer on on the team, it is
very difficult for the development developers to set up that kind of automation, and that eventually leads to increased
time of implementation, because every time you want to roll out some change, you're spending a lot of time On the
process of deploying, whereas you could have just invested that time in more feature development. So that is where
DevOps come into play for startups. So with the limited budget, you have to a higher DevOps team member is probably
going to be going to put more strain on your budget at the same time, the lack of DevOps member onboard is slowing down
and delaying your go to market. So plant on Cloud offers that sweet spot where you don't have to have a DevOps number
because you don't have such complex environments, you have a bunch of micro services that can either be deployed to
Kubernetes or simple virtual machines, and you also want the code changes to go from every commit, they should be
deployed onto those services. And maybe in a lot of cases, bootstrapping is also a big deal. Another aspect of startups
that I think is very interesting is that, because you're a startup, usually team members come in and leave, so you want,
like, faster onboarding of new team members. Sometimes for you also rely on freelancers if you're a startup, so you want
a way for a place where your there is so much information available for your new team member to get on board as quickly
as follow you. And if you're even though your startup, if you have so much automation in place, then even for people
coming on board, it is becomes much easier to directly start contributing to your features, which all of this is very
super valuable for startups, as long as the focus remains on feature development, the success of these startups is
higher. So now, what does the plankton crawl offer for all these is for faster onboarding. There is service hub with the
ability to bootstrap new projects using cookie cutter templates so that developers can developers within the startup can
quickly bootstrap Java, maker services, Golang maker services, or next chains, web apps, etc, etc. And the service hub
also offers the ability to add GitHub automation to build those projects on every commit, and there are GitHub actions
and GitHub workflows and GitLab templates readily available that can be added to those bootstrap source code
repositories, so that developers don't really have to spend any time to set up that automation. The next part of the
process is, how can developers deploy that code, or build code into Starbucks? Is that the multi cloud deployments
within within plant on Cloud offers zero configuration, no assistance required. Deployment of these micro services on
COVID or even virtual machines, etc, and the real time stack jobs, logs, meaning the real time deployment progress helps
developers to iterate quickly. Yeah, so, and another aspect for startups that is important is obviously the spend. So if
there's a solution like plant onboard is going to cost them a lot of money, then that becomes unbelievably Keeping this
in mind, we do offer like free subscription that suits most startups, but we also offer startups like a customized free
plan for the first year for their team with special applications they need To apply for to get that subscription, and we
continue based on their use case, if they if we think that the startup can benefit from plant on Cloud, we offer them a
free, full year subscription with upgraded features. And more importantly, because plankton cloud is an AI enabled
internal developer platform. The one of the things that is very difficult for startups is to have the new team members
learn a new tool like plant on cloud. So we eliminate that need by providing the mean a enabled artificial intelligence
enabled chat bot interface, and this interface essentially makes it very easy for these developers to ask for what they
want, just like they would go and ask for what they want from a full, full time DevOps engineer on their team. So plank
on Cloud offers so much value because you are immediately getting your return on investment because you are not spending
any time on the DevOps engineer, that one or two DevOps engineers, but you are getting all the benefits that you would
normally get, so you're saving all of that money right off the bat. So so much value for the money. And as I said, the
plant on cloud itself is built using plant on cloud. So there are so many essential features to build a sophisticated
product like plant on Cloud, with so many message queues, so many caching layers, so many cloud resources, so many open
source deployments that plant on Cloud relies on, and the fact that all of this is being done just with plant on Cloud
guarantees that most of the startups will find all the essential tools for their rapid development. So plan on Cloud is
itself. Is a startup with five member team and without a DevOps number on the team, and we rely on plankton cloud to
take care of all the things that it would DevOps engineer would typically do, and we have a Discord server where the
where we are actively engaging and helping any startup. So we offer support, like some, like a growing company would
with a shared Slack channel with DevOps engineers in them. So we are offering a community we are running a community
Discord server, which you can consider as your 24 by seven support channel, which doesn't cost you any money. So if you
post any issues that you come across, or your developers come across, then they can get help, either from the plant on
Cloud team or other community members. So overall, the benefits for startups, to summarize, is all the essential tools
for rapid development and cost effective because of a free tier. And also, and also this platform is Pay as You Grow
pricing model. So in most cases, once you go beyond the free plan, you are still spending very little money, because you
are only paying for the usage that you are making, and because you are a startup where there is a very good chance that
you're you're staying well within the limits, and it's not going to put a hole in your pocket and quick and easy
onboarding. That's a that's a big thing, because you're able to bootstrap projects, you're able to set up cacd For build
and deployments. And we also get Kubernetes dashboard integrations right off the bat, without having to configure any
coupe config for developers. So there is both CLI version and there is both console app and there is chat interface. So
your startup is getting like multiple types of interfaces, depending on what your engineering team is craving for. There
is something for everybody. So I think, yeah, I would like to conclude this discussion where we talked about the value
propositions offered by cranton Cloud for startups.

one aspect that we forgot to cover in the conversation for the benefits that plant startups get from plant on Cloud is
quick onboarding. So for any startup to start benefiting from all the various features provided by plan. Down close,
it's actually very, very simple. They need to sign up on one of the cloud provider they need to create accounts on
GitHub or GitLab, and they can either connect those two tools either from either from the user interface the console
app, or they can also do that using chat interface, which is powered by client or the DevOps co pilot, once the Cloud
account is connected, and once the source code repositories are connected, the developers will will be immediately able
to bootstrap the services and also easily configure those credentials. Also, one less talked about area where startups
kind of get a lot of value from random cloud is random cloud also allows developers to create package registries like
Docker registry or Maven registries, to store their packaged software very easily by allowing the developers to quickly
deploy GCP artifact registry or code artifacts on AWS or artifacts on Azure, etc. And this actually offers a lot of
value for startups, because it makes it very easy for startups to start creating reusable components, which they usually
stay away from, because it's hard to set up these kind of package industries also. So overall, the onboarding process is
very, very easy for developers. And one other value that plankton pro really shames at is it's very, very easy for
developers to deploy the software right from their laptop onto Kubernetes without having to configure any Kubernetes or
dealing with any Kubernetes configuration whatsoever. Plant on CLI makes it very, very easy for developers to deploy the
modified source code right from the laptops onto the samples. So this is one other area, and yeah, the overall
onboarding is fairly easy and quick, making plant on Cloud far more better solutions. So I would like to ask me a
question, if, if the free plans offer any less value over the pay like the higher plans. Obviously there are
differences, but I can confidently say that startups can can fully benefit from all the features available within the
free plan, and if they go beyond the free plan and if they are still a startup, they can always apply for startup,
discounts, which we offer a full year of higher plans and beyond. And we evaluate that based on their application.
