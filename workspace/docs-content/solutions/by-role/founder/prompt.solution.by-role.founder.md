I've been working on creating content for our new sales website, and our workflow is to for me as a product owner, to
clearly provide the various sections of each page on the sales website along with the site map of the number of pages,
etc, to our figma UX designer, I have done that for several pages until now, and now I'm working on providing those
section by section titles along with descriptions and any visual help. So the structure of the pages is hero section
follow the page sections, with each section having a title and a description and some kind of visualization, either a
video or a GIF or a image. So I would need your help on identifying the visual help for such pages. Right now we are
working on creating content for solution pages. So these pages are expected to repurpose the same information around the
product by aligning that information to a particular solution. So solutions are divided by role, company size and use
cases. If we take the example of solution from a company size perspective, we are going to provide content on on a
company size, say, startup, of what are those key elements that startups would really look for in a solution like plant
or not AI, and how can they benefit from using plant control as a solution for those problems? And we repeat this
process, or we apply the same logic for creating by coming up with content for all solution pages, it's these are not
feature pages. Feature pages are more about highlighting the features within the platform, regardless of who is looking
at it, whereas solution pages are more tailored towards aligning the content based on the visitor of that particular
page. So if somebody has opened startup solution page that means they are the visitor is either part of a startup or a
founder of a startup, etc. So this is what we are going to work together right now, I'm also sharing you the overall,
larger goal details, along with certain guidelines on how the structure should be aligned that can give you an idea of
how the rest of the pages have been created thus far. Along with those standard guidelines, I'm also going to give you
all the other pages that we have finalized so far, so that you have a pretty good idea of what the product is all about.
And at the end of all of this, I'm going to share a transcription that I recorded for explaining our product from that
solution perspective. Now, with all of this information, you are going to give me three options for the hero section, 10
page sections and a Call to Action section at the end.

NOTE: DO NOT NUMBER PAGE-SECTIONS in your response

## FOCUS OF THIS REQUEST - Solutions - By Role - Startup Founder

Most importantly put yourself in the role of a highly skilled developer tooling sales messaging creation expert for this
task.

## transcription for startup-founders

Okay, so, so far, we discussed about solutions by company size, and now we are going to continue the discussion of how
plant out cloud can offer can be a great solution for from the perspective of startup founders. So to begin with, plan
on Cloud is an AI enabled internal developer platform. And the mission, our mission is to enable organizations to
provide the developers with with a powerful platform that can enable all those developers to focus on features while
making all the operational burden a self service and as intuitive as possible. With, with the help of a conversational
interfaces. Now then, what does it have to do with any startup founder? So any any startup founder building a technology
product that requires software development, like examples would be any mobile apps, any web apps or any kind of back end
engineering products. All of these products would require a group of developers to work on building and decline software
and quickly iterating. So we kind of discussed a lot about what, what is, what are the those aspects that are very
critical for a startup to succeed in our previous conversation about how planned on Cloud can be a good solution for
startups itself and a lot there is, there is going to be a lot of overlap between how planned on Cloud is a great
solution for a startup and how plant on Cloud can be a great solution for startup. From the lens of the startup founder,
there is going to be a lot of overlap, because the goals align startups and startup founders are all like trying to do
the same thing, which is make sure they build a product and go to market as quickly as possible. So again, for startup
founder, it's very important that his vision comes to reality as quickly as possible. So faster time to market is
something that every startup founder aims to shoot for, but he needs to provide his team the tools that he needs,
whether it is solo founder or a small group of developers, the need for an extra DevOps engineer is going to put a
strain on their budget and also lack of self service options means that the developers are relying getting bottlenecked
on that one, one or two DevOps engineers, until they kind of get what they want from the DevOps engineer. So there is
definitely added time waiting, waiting, and which kind of is is a killer for startups which need to be moving at Ultra
moving ultra fast. So plant on Cloud provides that platform for their developers which doesn't which obviates the need
for hiring a DevOps engineer, yet gets provide Simpsons. So for a startup founder, it is a wise choice to sign up on
plant, on Cloud, create an organization, invite those first few developers and give them access to this self service
developer platform that can enable by a chat in professional cases, so that the Developers kind of go from bootstrapping
new projects and deploying all the way into production, so that the iteration cycles are much quicker when when the app
goes from the laptop to an endpoint that can be accessed by other developers, sorry, the target, initial target
customers and get feedback, then their iteration cycles are going to be much quicker. And the next thing that people
care about, or startup founders care about, is obviously cost efficiency. So the free plan will be suitable for most of
the startup founders, but and we are also doing pay cut pay by usage. So startups, it's not going to cost them anyway.
As they grow, their spending is going to grow and plan conclude and for early stage startups, we also want to offer
budget friendly plans, meaning subject to application. We can offer one or two years of free, free subscription with
advanced features so that to set up startup founder to bring his team to the admin and while rapid development and cost
efficiency are factors, one of the key advantages of having a tool that takes off the operational burden is their
ability to focus on innovating. So because they don't really have to spend time on creating automation or even wait on
deploying stuff, they can definitely get all of their focus on innovating in what they are trying to achieve. and plan
on Cloud offers Discord server built insert community, Discord server, where more founders are leveraging platform codes
so they get an opportunity to meet our co founders, or other founders and get to understand how their leverage Inc went
on Cloud to iterate faster on their idea.

## transcription about dog-fooding

Okay, so I would like to actually, I would like to actually tell a story about how plant on cloud was bootstrapped and
how we operate today. And I want chatgpt to use this information to build a narrative and spin this information across
all the solution pages or even various parts of the sales website building. And the story is platinum. Cloud is a
sophisticated product with a distributed architecture, and it has lots of micro services between Golang, Java, Python,
it has a CLI, it has web apps, and we do use Kubernetes to deploy all of these services. And we also random clothes.
Architecture also requires Elastic Search, solar, Kafka, Redis, Postgres, MongoDB, open FGA for authorization. So there
is so many open source solutions software that is needed for this product to work, and more often, we boots up new
services, and we also troubleshoot or get to see what you're running on Kubernetes to quickly troubleshoot something in
the dev environments. And we also frequently rely on log streaming capabilities of plant and cloud to see what's
happening inside those pods, without any centralized logging solutions, etc. So in a way, we are a group of four people,
two back end engineers and one DevOps, one UX engineer and one web developer. So two back end engineers, one UX designer
and one web developer. With this small team, we are able to move much like a lot quicker, and there is no DevOps member
on the team, but we can kind of deploy all of this infrastructure with self service, without any additional DevOps
knowledge needed, and all with the chat interface. So we are kind of dogfooding all of that ourselves, which kind of
proves the value that this platform offers to startups like us, and we see how this platform can actually be helpful as
we grow, because we have added the abilities of team management and all the visibility features, etc. So again, I'm just
talking about how plant on Cloud is being used extensively to build plankton cloud so that chatgpt will find this
information and apply this information on wherever, whichever pages I request for, but now not by mentioning it is okay
to also mention how plankton cloud is being built using plant on Cloud. There is nothing to hide there, and we are happy
to include that information on the sales website if chatgpt finds that as a meaningful edition.
