All right, continuing. Um the steps in the onboarding process once uh the organization creator uh invites all of his team members um then then next step u I mean it's not essential that organization owner we'll have to invite other members if uh organization owner is the only member who is going to use uh planton cloud. Um so yeah for uh the onboarding process uh we want to first understand uh why the user wants to use the platform. Um because uh the platform offers uh two different uh uh features. One is uh deploying cloud infrastructure on on any of the clouds or they want to simply leverage u the CAC without really having to write any uh code uh deployment built-in deployment code but it is it is almost uh the platform offers maximum benefits if you leverage uh all of the features that it offers. So let's assume that uh all users coming to the platform will definitely get started by connecting their cloud account. So uh right now because uh we lack guided onboarding experience Uh um two ways uh that a user is can get to adding a new cloud account is um by going to uh f first of all uh uh it these two steps can be performed uh in in any order it doesn't matter uh I let uh the LLMs choose what uh would be the right uh uh workflow to design So basically um in order to start deploying infrastructure uh we want uh um the users to connect their cloud accounts. So they can go to connections and click on the connect button next to each uh each of the uh cards and we'll take screenshots of these uh screens as well. And uh they provide inputs uh necessary they fill a form to connect uh their cloud account by providing the information about their cloud account and once they uh provide the information and click submit we show the connected account details uh and we can show the details page as well we'll put a screenshot of that and we'll show the example with AWS account okay but in order to start deploying infrastructure all infrastructure uh needs environments the infrastructure cannot be deployed at plant oncloud organization level As explained in the resource hierarchy um all connections are at organization level but all infrastructure is at environment level. So users have to first create new environment. The names of environments are just names. So user can choose uh uh either dev produ or just test whatever is there. Uh and environment names have to be lower case and uh only lower case alpha numeric. uh with hyphens are allowed and nothing else. So they can click create and an environment gets created and it automatically is set as the context. Uh you can go back and set the context to the organization by going to the context selector and clicking on the organization in the resource hierarchy. Now once uh a connection has been created um let's let's uh go through the process of creating the connection. Say I have populated uh the form to submit create AWS account or connect AWS account with some sample but semantically correct values. And on the uh connecting AWS account it is important that uh the user selects the environments in which this this account or connection is authorized to be used. Uh without this uh infrastructure cannot be deployed to these environment. Cloud resources cannot be deployed to these environments using this cloud credential. Now the once we click submit we uh the AWS uh account connection gets created and it is shown in the existing connections list uh for which I am taking screenshots as well. and uh clicking on the connection would show the connection details for which I'm taking the screenshot as well. And uh on this page if uh more uh environments are uh granted permission uh then new environments are created and those environments also need to be authorized. Uh uh then they can do so by selecting new environments. And uh once uh the connection is created and authorized. Then uh in order to create that uh infraub uh the users can explore the deployment component store and uh filter or simply search for what they want to deploy. Say for example a user wants to create a VP see on the newly connected AWS account, they can search for the Lego block and uh see the details if they want to uh on the deployment component store for the Lego block um which also displays the list um shows links to the built-in provided Terraform and Polomi modules and they can click deploy to uh to create the VPC and they provide a name for the VPC which is not uh the name of the VPC itself. It will be the it'll be used as a meta data name for every cloud resource we create. In fact, every resource that is created on planton cloud platform will have a name. So that is what is provided here and VPC cider block and all the specific configuration for uh creating the VPC should be filled with the form. So I'm taking screenshots of uh this uh deploying VPC form as well. I also took screenshots of uh the deployment component store. and I took screenshot of uh the user entering the component that they want to search deploy in the search and I took the screenshot of the deployment uh component details screen showing the information and uh link quick links to the terraform and pulumi modules. So this is how um the user can deploy infrastructure. But uh in a lot of cases
