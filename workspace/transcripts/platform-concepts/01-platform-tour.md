Okay, we are going to continue the getting uh getting started. So I signed up as a new user and uh because I landed on this uh console app on the landing page as a new user via login or signup flow. Uh the first thing at this point I am not part of any organization. Um so um I need to create an organization to get started. So before creating an organization uh we can also show them uh the tour for the user uh and this will actually help us in crafting the platform documentation. Okay. So this is this yeah like as part of getting started one would need to understand the basic constructs of the platform itself. So I'm going to give a quick tour of the platform showing various sections of the console app. So on the top left corner in the um right neck on the right side of the logo there is context selection component similar to Google cloud uh and this context selection shows organization/ environment which is similar to the Google cloud organization or project selection drop-down and in fact we have used the same same techniques that we observed uh in Google clouds the context selector uh which shows the resource hierarchy and clicking on any particular element in the hierarchy sets the context to that the nuance is very important the way Google cloud designed that component is every um node in that hierarchy tree is a link and clicking on that link sets that as a context and the same context uh but shows create new organization on or environment. Um but we'll talk about how to create an organization and environment in later section but focus on the platform tour at this point. So we looked at the context and uh moving to the right side of uh the header there is ask copilot. So this is the planton cloud um cloud resource deployment copilot. Uh clicking on that will open uh the chat organization but for that to happen uh and create an organization is necessary. Uh but the on on the right side of uh the copilot icon on the header there is deployment component store. Uh so this is um for first let's go through the sidebar. So the dashboard currently shows which is the first item in the sidebar shows uh an illustration asking the user to get started by creating an organization. And the second item is infraub. So um infraub okay it seems like uh first let me create an organization because I think this is interfering with my ability to explain uh the platform itself. So we'll create an organization for now called uh uh getting started is the organization name and uh I'm also specifying the same as uh organization name can be free form text and there are no restrictions getting started inc and uh the ID itself is getting hyphen started I click create and now uh whoever creates the organization becomes the owner of that organization and immediately that organization is set up as the context. Uh so if I go back to the context selection I can now see that uh there is um uh getting started uh organization um we don't have any environments yet we'll get to that later now going back to the sidebar I click on infraub so there are two tabs one is called cloud resources and another one is called infra projects so uh this is the place infraub is the place where all of the cloud infrastructure deployments are managed so that is its relevance as part of the platform And when it comes to infraub itself, what all uh connect uh providers are supported for deploying cloud infrastructure? Those are shown in the connections tab. Uh and um all the cloud providers uh like Amazon web services, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, CEO, Cloudflare, even an existing Kubernetes is a platform on which you can deploy cloud resources. So that is what uh those are the various platforms and now what can you deploy on each platform is shown in the deployment component store which is to the right side of uh the ask copilot so I'm taking screenshots of all of these uh maybe I can take screenshots uh by pausing the video at later point as well I guess so yeah uh so deployment components to is a place where we show the what we call Lego blocks. Each Lego block is a component on the cloud provider. So if we filter on the cloud AWS, you'll see the most popular uh components that are deployed. Um and uh the component store also has a concept called infra charts. Charts is like Helm charts. Uh Lego blocks are like individual Kubernetes resources for the sake of analogy. And infra charts are uh akin to Helm charts where u it is possible to uh compose a collection of these Lego blocks uh that we saw on the first tab uh to deploy the collection of those resources in one go and we call them infraarts. Uh so the component store contains Lego blocks which are platform defined and these cannot be um uh updated by the users. These are platform crafted only and we keep adding more and more cloud providers and logo blocks. And when it comes to charts, uh the platform offers built-in uh charts but the users the organization members can publish their own infra charts and we'll talk about that later but overall yeah that's the concept. Now we covered infraub which is uh you can deploy cloud infrastructure by connecting the your cloud provider account and going to um the deployment component store and either choosing individual Lego blocks or a collection of Lego blocks called infra charts to get started and deploy infrastructure. So now uh going back to the overview of the platform itself you have the resource hierarchy uh which is organization environments and uh you have in hub to deploy. But you have the concept of connections and the connections provide a way to connect various third party uh services which also include the cloud providers and package management uh um package providers like Maven or npm um or even source code management systems like GitHub, GitLab and Docker registry and uh even Terraform or Pulumi state backends uh Um all of these fall under connections that external systems uh are connections and um any previously connected uh systems are shown on existing connections. Um now service hub is the next item in the sidebar and uh this helps developers to deploy build and deploy services. So service hub can be thought of as versal but for back end in your cloud. Uh and service hub can also be thought of as GitHub actions fully built into planton cloud and uh the service hub is for to build and pipeline orchestration is powered by technon open source part but um yeah service hub allows the end users to connect uh their github or gitlab accounts select repositories and uh uh map the g repositories to the notion of services on the platform uh And uh the services um so whenever new commits are made uh we plant cloud picks up the new commits and runs build and deployments automatically. The deployments are tied into infraub which we'll dig into later. And uh we also have the billing section uh at at a platform level. Each organization will have to choose one subscription uh free plus or Pro uh and they need to set up uh billing for plus and pro accounts. Um and yeah the and also uh an organization the owner of the organization can invite uh more members into uh this organization and uh the way they invite people is by providing an email and Plantum Cloud will send an email uh and they need to choose a role for the new invited member. So that as soon as the the newly the invite whoever receives the invite they need to either have an existing account on plant on cloud or they need to create a new account uh just like the way the organization owner created an account and uh upon um they they'll be able to follow the instructions the guided onboarding experience from the email that they received to join this organization. Unlike uh the owner who created the organization uh did not have any organizations as soon as they got started the invited members since they already have are part of an organization they won't be prompted to create an organization they'll be directly uh they'll able to join the organization and get started from here the settings section on the left hand sidebar shows the uh members within the organization and any pending invitations and the ability to copy the uh invitation link if they want to and share it with um the invited user if they don't receive an email or they don't have access to the email. And um here uh the organization owner or whoever has permissions, they'll also be able to grant access higher level access to the members of the organization which we'll talk about later. And there is also concept of teams uh within Planton cloud and um um teams allow the organization members to grant access to um all of their uh team members and set permissions accordingly. U so that uh this is this allows them to simplify access management. Now we talked about deployment component store and the the platform also has built-in IA registry module registry. So for each Lego block within the deployment component store. Um there is a corresponding pulumi and terraform module which are available on our opensource project called project planton and all of these modules are can be explored on the IA module registry and uh uh the platform also supports customizing these IA modules and organizations can publish the customized IA modules into this registry. Um so this is you can think of IC like the terraform registry but built within plant on cloud and also access a full-fledged IA module registry for your organization. So yeah that completes the tour of the platform right now. Um
