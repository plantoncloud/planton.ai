All right. In this video, I'm going to capture how one would get started on Planton cloud. And uh the purpose of this recording is to definitely update uh the documentation page on um um the planton.ai website to add a getting started page. So I'm going to basically go through the process of getting started myself right now. and we'll use these instructions to craft uh that getting started page. I'm also going to take a few screenshots along the way and um we will uh we will use those screenshots uh within the documentation pages. All right, let's let's go. So I am on planton AI and on this page uh the users can either click on login or join beta. Um so I'm taking a screenshot of uh that and uh once I click on login the users will be taken to a sign up form. But uh here the users get confused which is the is a single login single page for both login and sign up. So when users click on login or join beta they both both of them take it take uh the user to um the login form directly and users will have to click on the sign up uh button to actually sign up. And uh if I click on uh sign up um then uh The user will be prompted to enter email address and password. Um or they can also choose continue with Google to use their Google account login if they choose to. But it's optional. Uh users can log in in using either of these two forms. And uh I'm taking the screenshots for uh uh the landing page I mean the first page that the user sees and also uh taking the screenshot of the signup page so that these can be added there. Cool. Um I am going to sign up uh using uh test account. and um yeah I click on continue. So what happens when a user first logs in is they are shown uh welcome to beta banner uh showing like letting them know that the platform is still in beta. So they we still like refining features and experiences. So we we would like to request their understanding uh and patience uh if the platform is not as stable. So user clicks on continue platform and here right now the guided onboarding experience is not uh uh implemented and uh probably we are going to leverage this getting started workflow to actually come up with the right uh u onboarding experience like right now whatever we are going to go through we will let uh the onboarding experience take the user through the same workflow. Uh so yeah we'll leverage this uh recording for that purpose as well. So yeah I'll stop this recording and mark this as like the signup completed and then we'll start another recording.
