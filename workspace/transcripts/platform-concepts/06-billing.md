So when it comes to how we keep track of the usage, as I mentioned previously, we have three different subscriptions, free, plus and pro. Um free. Um so basically since this is an automation platform, uh the way we charge our customers is based on the subscriptions. Uh uh so there is per se per month subscription. So the free subscription is $0. per seat and plus subscription is $19 per seat and there is a pro plan which does not charge per seat. It provides unlimited number of uh seats uh is what the pro plan comes with. Um so that that forms the primary subscription part but there is an usage based component within the billing and it is associated with the build and deployment minutes. So um the all the services whenever they make uh developers make a commit. Um the number of minutes each of um uh taken by a pipeline to complete the build stage and the total number of deployment minutes whether the deployments are triggered by service from service hub or by uh the creation or updation of individual Lego blocks or even then like collection of Lego blocks managed via infraarts all result or count towards the deployment minutes. So uh we keep track of the number of build plus deployment minutes and we call this automation runner minutes or automation minutes and uh every subscription comes with uh included uh runner minutes. So the free plan comes with 100 free runner minutes. The plus subscription comes with 300 free automation runner minutes and the pro subscription comes with uh,000 free automation runner minutes and all plans will acrewue overage at 0.06 uh dollars per minute that is 6 cents per minute which is $6 per 100 uh minutes and the free plan uh caps at 100 uh free automation minutes but there is no overage billing uh at which point they need to upgrade to plus plan. Um so yeah all plans come Um all the paid plans come with a generous free trial during which uh members can um uh try out the platform and see if it works out uh well for them. So that covers uh most of the platform level uh concepts that needs to be documented in the documentation website.
