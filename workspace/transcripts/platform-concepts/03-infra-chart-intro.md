But uh it is not always necessary. There are rarely customers uh who used uh um the product uh are either developers or uh uh DevOps engineers who doesn't want to like these two groups have already been used to creating terraform projects where multiple all of their environment can be created as one single model. module and uh um they can kick off the module by providing inputs and uh expect uh the module to prepare the environment ready to deploy services. So our initial customers have provided that feedback and uh expressed uh a concern around uh the Lego blocks method. Although we make it uh super simple to create uh the consistency experience across cloud multiple cloud providers. These early customer who don't care about multicloud consistency they only cared about the differences between their experiences of uh traditional uh deployments versus u what plant cloud uh has to offer. They didn't really find a lot of value in creating these individual Lego blocks. Uh for example um both of our early customers uh they rely on AWS CS service um on AWS. But in order to create uh prepare the environment u in a fresh AWS account so that they can start deploying multiple ECS services they had to create uh multiple ECR repositories multiple AWS VPCs uh sorry one AWS VPC ALBM role security group manager search route 53 zone ECS cluster etc. um each of these they had to fill as a sub Lego block form. Um and uh the frustrating part here is um every time u the users uh uh pro like uh submit the form for a Lego block they'll we and immediately a stack job gets triggered. Uh stack job is basically is uh sequence of terraform or pulley operations. So for example if the developer creates the VPC by subitting ing the form he needs to wait until the stack job for VPC is completed which creates uh the subnets and uh other stuff as part of the VPC net gateway and stuff and uh they can only create the security group and after the VPC is created um but this is not the case in the terraform experience because uh the terraform provides terapform or puli provides built-in dependency tree so that they can write all of these as one environment module and kick it off. So to uh u provide that similar experience on planton cloud we introduced the concept of infraarts. Infraarts is basically um inspired from the concept of helm charts. If you think of Lego blocks as uh kubernetes uh APIs like deployment service, ingress etc. Uh although initially everyone was happy creating those individual Lego blocks independently, clear patterns evolved and a set of collection collection of those Kubernetes API objects are consistently created together and which uh created um made space for creating the concept of Helm charts. So we took the same philosophy and introduce the concept of infraart API in our system and infraart is essentially uh a collection of those Lego blocks with uh the ability to uh declare dependencies by the in the form of value from um so uh uh and we created uh the popular info charts uh that on all cloud providers um for demonstration purposes and AWS EC ECS environment infochart was being used by our early customers in production today and uh similar to Lego blocks every info chart will have its own detail page explaining its purpose and we also show directed asyclic graph of an infra chart on the console uh with all icons and stuff and we also show the templates similar to Helm. Um and uh these templates can cross reference each other like for example in case of uh VPC once it is created the security can uh derive the VPC ID uh from the previously created VPC by referring uh using value from pattern uh as can be seen in the video uh So yeah, I'm going to take uh screenshots of uh these directed asylic graphs as well. Um and uh the way these info charts work is just like the way the Lego blocks have forms, these info charts also come with uh a dynamic form which is rendered based on the values file of a uh of an input uh of each each of the values entries which also includes boolean types and uh depending on the boolean toggles. The directed ACL graph will uh be updated uh to add or remove nodes from this. And uh these infrastructs templates are purely Ginga templates, fully Ginga compatible templates by the way. So once uh um I'll continue the concept of what is called an infro project in the next video.
