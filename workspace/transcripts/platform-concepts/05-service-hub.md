Overview. Continuing the overview of the platform. Once uh the infrastructure or the environment to deploy services is prepared in the uh cloud accounts, the next uh um requirement from developers is to be able to deploy services. And for that to happen uh we created uh service hub. Service hub will essentially allow the users to connect their git uh repositories whether on GitLab or GitHub and provides a versel like DX experience meaning when the developers connect their uh git repositories the platform will receive git commits and runs full CI/CD pipelines right in within the planton cloud platform and uh these CI/CD pipelines are powered by tecton so every new commit would run CACD pipeline and C the um the every CAC pipeline or uh every commit will result in a pipeline object in our system. Pipeline has two stages build and deploy. The build stage can include uh will produce a container image. Uh and the build stage is fully orchestrated by Tecton and the users will be able to follow the live progress of the uh build stage. task logs uh which are streamed to a planton cloud platform by tecton using a file uh transfer uh agent. Now this is where uh um the fusion we created a fusion between the service hub and infraub. So because the uh deployment uh deployment component needed to run services are also modeled under the in the same in deployment component store as Lego block. For example, if the user wants to deploy this container image as a service on ECS, then uh then the user needs to pro create an ECS Lego block um but provide the image repo and tag based uh coming from the service hub on the commit. So to make this simple, we provided uh uh a mechanism within the repository um by with the open-source technology uh which is customized. So a repository uh in which the source code for the service remains which is connected uh on planton cloud as a service it needs to have a customized folder um inside it uh with overlay directories and base directories and the YAML manifest representing this Lego block is uh is added to the customiz folder. And um the plant code CACD pipeline will also capture run the customized build in the repository as part of every commit. And it exports the Lego block YAML manifest. And that we we basically apply that manifest creating the new Lego block creating or updating and we because this is related to CACD pipelines every commit we use the commit tag to patch the ECS server. Lego block. Um and uh the customized configuration will also support providing uh environment variables, secret, CPU and memory allocations. Everything that is associated with a ECS service Lego block is all located in the repository right along the service code as um um as customiz configuration. Uh so customize is only leveraged for the YAML merging of base and multiple environment segregation of the configuration and uh yeah so the so we leveraged all of the foundational infra cloud resource management to nicely u formed the full pipeline of build and deployments um thus creating an end toend uh experience for developers without having to write any sort of CI/CD configuration and the pipelines also support built-in mechanism of um building the container image either using docker file or build packs and all of this is already documented on uh the documentation website. So the his all the list of uh existing uh uh commits and their respective pipelines triggered on the platform can be seen on the platform itself. And these pipelines are also customizable and we'll talk more about uh it uh when we talk about the pipeline. So that essentially covers uh the experience of new developers from creating an organization to inviting their members and building teams and creating environments and adding connections and creating uh the cloud resources using Lego blocks or infra charts and uh the management of infra uh life cycle of an infra project which is created from an infra chart and uh the visual DAG representation of uh showing the progress of an infra project and also uh this concept of service hub and services and pipelines um and uh the build stage and deployment stage within a pipeline and billing subscriptions and uh teams and uh managing members uh and deployment component store and IA module registry and AI uh copilot All of this uh forms the platform layer and um in the next section I'll explain how we keep uh track of uh the usage which which we tie into how we calculate the billing for the organization that covers the platform layer.
