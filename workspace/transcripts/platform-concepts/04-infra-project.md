So when the user uh fills up uh the form of an infra chart by providing just a few set of inputs uh we then need need to keep track of. So basically this single form will create a collection of Lego blocks and uh the platform will orchestrate the deployment deployments of each of these Lego logs in the as a directed as click graphs based on the relationships that are constructed uh based on the value from references within the templates. So these are platform provided u infraarts and when the user clicks on deploy for an infraart then the platform creates what are called infra projects and infra projects are basically uh I'll show you an example of infraarts uh for a different user. So infraarts are basically um an infra project is a infra chart with the specific chosen values with its own infra pipeline history. tree. So as you can see an info charts when it is created the platform orchestrates the deployments of each of these Lego blocks and uh and the user will be able to see the full configuration of each of the Lego blocks by clicking on each icon within the directed as graph and they can also follow the live progress of terraform or pulumi stack job for each of the uh Lego block and uh they can see the live prog address and notice that uh the security group uh Lego block is waiting for the uh VPC to be completed. So this is a nice virtual representation of this workflow which is probably way better than the pre the world of terapform modules where yes the relationships are inherent but there is no this rich DAG visualization available. So that's a uh our initial users have uh uh loaded this view that they are given and by the end it takes about 15 minutes for the entire infrastructure uh ready to deploy ECS services is provisioned. So an infra project uh although we created it from an infra chart there are other sources for a for an infra project um which we'll explore or dive deeper in later sections. So So uh that completes the infra uh hub part. However, I I want to bring your attention to another important aspect which is regardless of whether the cloud resources are created using Lego block or infra projects or several cloud resources may be created from several different infra projects. But all the cloud resources that are deployed in an organization can be visualized on a canvas. Again, with all the relationships uh captured and indexed in in a graph database. Uh which will this is a rich visualization which will help the users to understand the blast radius or uh uh so when a configuration is changed it is easy to figure out what all resources are going to be affected by it. And the same list of cloud resources can also be viewed as a list list view in the cloud resources tab on RA hub. Clicking on each deployed cloud resource will show the full configuration and the stack outputs which are Terraform or Pulumi outputs um generated after the Lego block deployment is completed. We capture and persist them in the in Plantum cloud data store alongside the configuration provided by the user and user will also be able to see the historical changes as captured as Git versions and uh every The configuration change for these Lego blocks will immediately trigger uh another stack job providing a GitOps like experience uh right from the UI.
