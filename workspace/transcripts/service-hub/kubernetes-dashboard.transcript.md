Once the services are deployed, depending on where they are deployed, we are also again as part of DevOps in a box solution we wanted to continue the journey of a developer or an ops engineer who deploys their service onto one of these platforms to follow up on the view of for this particular service, for example, we are looking at a service that is deployed on Kubernetes. On the details tab slider of a cloud resource lego block, if it is a resource that is deployed on Kubernetes, you will see a Kubernetes icon. This is not just for services that are deployed on Kubernetes; this is true for any lego block that gets deployed on Kubernetes. The details pane will have that Kubernetes icon, and clicking on that will essentially open up a canvas showing the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of all the Kubernetes resources created for this particular service.

I'm taking a screenshot of this DAG view, DAG Canvas view that shows the list of Kubernetes resources created, and we call this Kubernetes dashboard. Some screenshots of the various features that we offer on this dashboard. First of all, as you can notice, this is not an entire Kubernetes cluster view. This is Kubernetes resources view nicely represented as a DAG, only showing the portion of the Kubernetes that is relevant for this service. This makes it more approachable for developers because they also show all the relationships between all these different Kubernetes resources and prevents them from getting overwhelmed because they don't see everything in the Kubernetes only sees what is necessary or is related to their service. Clicking on each of these Kubernetes resource icons will show the edit exec into pod, delete view details, and stream logs are only available for a particular type of icons or nodes of kind pod, and the others will have delete, view, edit actions. Clicking on view delete icon would show, and I created screenshots for each of these actions (except quad container and this view icon). Clicking on view icon will show the kubectl describe of that resource and also kubectl get yaml format. The users are also able to edit the YAML and save, and that will save the objects in Kubernetes itself. This is more like a day 2 operations that is post deployment operations for Kubernetes services deployed on Kubernetes. They can even accept into running Kubernetes pod by so they need to select the pod that you want to accept into, click on the exact button, and select the container and choose a shell, and they should be able to run commands within that container. So yeah, they can create files or check environment variables and run any type of command right within the browser console. This is powerful which makes it very makes Kubernetes approachable for developers without having to deal with kube config setup or anything. So this we're going to extend the post deployment operations to combine observability in our future releases that's on our roadmap which is to check do health checks, check memory and like resource utilisation, and also bring in cost transparency that is all post deployment cloud visitation. But that is all for future, it's not currently available here, and what we are all and similar dashboards right now. We have completed creating the cloud ops experience for Kubernetes, and we are going to extend the similar functionality for anything that is deployed onto AWS as well. So there is going to be AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run dashboard, so we are going to create different types of dashboards for different views to make cloud ops approachable for developers.
