Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, so I'm with Suresh, and we both are going to review, start reviewing the website content, the sales website content for plant run.ai, and the current designs that if shell has put together already, and the purpose of this discussion is so right now, the work that is still pending and needs to be get done for the website to be fully built out, is the media meaning. Because this is a new product, there is obviously a lot of new terms that we introduced, which we averted as much as possible. We didn't want to introduce any new words keep like because of the fact that new terminology requires education so and the important part is the sales website is for positioning in the market. Like, what do we want the market to think of us? And website plays a critical role. It is the tool that helps us get that positioning across to the market. And we felt like ever since we built plant or as a DevOps co pilot, we felt like That should be the face of the product, meaning we changed our positioning from calling ourselves as an internal development platform to being a conversational DevOps platform, while the category still remains to be an internal developer platform, well, there is a lot of other people who are calling themselves as internal developer platform. So we need to position. We need to adjust our positioning so that we kind of stand out and so and again, what is pending is, although we added various sections to this each each page, there is section title and and then there is some brief discussion description About the section, while this may definitely give some idea to our target audience, it may also not fully make sense, and because we feel like we are trying shooting for product led growth, meaning we think we have built up Great product, and which means if we can give the glimpse of the best features of the product fairly quickly, and make it very easy for somebody to know about those awesome, awesome things, at least in our perception, those are awesome features, and we we strongly believe that for us, product led growth is possible because of the quality of the product that we have put together, and these section titles and section descriptions will not help us achieve that goal of educating the visitors of this website to quickly understand the quality or the value proposition that the product has to offer. And for that to happen, the only next thing is for them to sign up and see that in action. But obviously users are not going to do it, so we want to make it very easy for them to get a glimpse. And the purpose of this discussion is exactly, is to exactly understand or discuss what's the best elements in the in our application that can that we can capture a in different formats and add to each of these sections. So we want to fill up lots of content here and in different formats. So the formats that are available are GIF. We can draw it out, to write it out. So the format that are available for us are, there is GIF or plain old PNGs, and then, and then these GIFs can be as short as, say, five seconds, and they can be as long as 20 seconds to in fact, they can go beyond and they can also be up to one minute. I don't know what's the consequence of creating the GIF. Gifs have the disadvantage of they won't allow the user to scroll forward or backwards. I think it is possible to pause and resume. I've seen that on GitHub and restart, but users cannot drag wildly different so that is why usually these are not long. And then another element is obviously videos. So videos are of various types, like illustration videos hand drawn, whiteboard drawings or recordings, whiteboards, recording or iPad, iPad or hand whiteboard is more or less the same. It's a different tool. That's all there is pen, there is surface to write, whether it is iPad or whiteboard. But if it is whiteboard, most likely human face is going to probably it's hard to remove it, I guess. Or maybe it's still possible. Maybe we can stand some far off and we can have the camera here and draw that that is also an option, or iPad with the pen on it and the camera from top down. So those are ways to do it, and screen recordings and or a combination of both iPad explanations and screen recording, these require editing and nirshad might be able to help us to edit, but so the stock steps so for PNGs and jits, PNGs don't need any preparation. We just have to decide which what should again, PNGs are also of same type, either it is hand sketch showing some architecture diagram or something, or it can also be a screenshot from the app, from either from the app or from figma, If you need any customizations and GIF also require like, some type of screen recording and then convert it into GIFs. We can do hand sketches with GIFs. Oh, well, hand sketches with GIFs are also possible. I tested it out, which is, we can do a screen record of this thing iPad where we draw, or, like, do some type of animation and record it and convert it into a GIF. This is also good hack. You can do colors, icons and all of that on the iPad, so we have that. And then we say, we simply, like, draw a connection, and then connection back. And if you record it, it becomes a nice GIF, unless, unlike a static image where we have like, two points, A and B, if you want to show an interaction, yeah, just hands drawn sketch will help. Or we can say, put a and b first, and then start recording the iPad, and then do something like this, and then something like this, so it becomes more interactive. That's that's like a lightweight way to create GIFs, but engaging. So coming to videos, the workflow for videos is obviously record, edit and publish. However, for all these three, all of these are regardless of the format, the important part is, what do we want to convey? What is, what is the message that we are trying to get, get across to the visitors, and because we don't want to record long videos. That is where these section titles come in, right? So they obviously, they're already very narrowly scoped that which is helpful. Up until now, all of the initiatives to create the content have failed because of that broader scope. Yeah. Also, are we not

Suresh Attaluri  9:03  
thinking of text to explain this, create this content is also a form of content, right? So, script,

Swarup Donepudi  9:13  
yeah, that is preparation. What is it like a trans so that begins with the question, which is,

Suresh Attaluri  9:21  
I'm not talking about script. I'm saying in a web page, we can convey that message

Swarup Donepudi  9:27  
that is text, video, image or text is already there. That's the point, right? Like, this is what we have come up with already, okay? But that is why I said refining that is a version two goal right now we want to, like, go through full iteration first, or even when we are discussing, if you identify that. Well, this section can be properly rephrased here. We can accommodate those, but coming up with those titles and all was already a lot of preparation, same kind of discussions. But the goal ultimately, we knew that these, this messaging and positioning, will have to iterate. We go one full round, etc, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  10:19  
But yeah, that is so my point was, I don't know what others are doing in other websites, the content is more of text or more of a video things.

Swarup Donepudi  10:29  
So as I said, I kind of set the bar high when it came to website, because I feel like this is an opportunity for us to stand out from the crowd too, because I felt like we have put in so much hard work into the app, and when it comes to selling, if we don't like for example, whenever we built any feature, we went to great lengths to kind of make sure we do the best possible work on those features, right? I think this area is where that creativity has to be at a game. So I am where, what is it that other people are doing versus like? Should we simply, like, follow their cue? I'm like, we have an opportunity. I think what others are doing is very much like, the hero sections will have one video explaining stuff, and all sections will have some kind of mostly text and title with some kind of random animation, but it didn't feel like they have put in so much care into each section. But because we are in the process of creating that website, obviously those founders were also in the same shoes as we are in right now when they were creating website, right it is a lot of work. So they might have been like, okay, let's, let's get, get past this. And in a way, we are also trying to do that so but so far, we have done so much research to make it possible for us to create these meaning. What I am saying is we have arranged tooling, we have gotten all the cameras, we kind of figured out what software to use. So all of that hard work has been done for a very long time. But where are we stuck is, what do we want to show if this can be figured out? Then we have we are totally capable of doing something that most others are not doing, which is provide much more easier explanations for the visitors, so that they truly understand why something was built. Okay, so that is the whole point of this agenda, why we are meeting. So we kind of, I'll first explain the structure of the page, what went into structuring the content like that, and we'll see on GitHub what, what is the section title and what is the text, so that without the UI part, you will be able to understand whether or not the text in isolation? Is it like actually conveying what, what it is supposed to convey? And then we'll move on to the visual elements, which irshad has already put together on figma. And finally, on figma. While we are on figma, we'll figure out what can be added there an image, a GIF, or a video. If, if we decide on these, we think about like, what? What part of the app should we record? Like, maybe like, do we want to create a Redis Database to demonstrate this particular capability? Or do we have to issue or grant some access to some resource to demonstrate this capability to the visitor in a better way. So these are the conversations that we are going to have, and obviously we are taking recording all of this, so we are going to use this transcription and feed it into chat GPT, and get get a step by step process from chatgpt. And maybe I can also ask chatgpt based on, hey, here is what we thought. So what do you think? If it's like, yeah, you can create this chief, and I'm explicitly calling out all of these tools. And the way we can do these things is to let chatgpt know that, hey, these are the tools we have, and these are like thoughts we came up with, etc, okay, yes, with that. Okay, yeah. Here is the landing page, landing main page, so every page will have what is called Hero section. Hero section is popular in like a web dev space, where that is the first thing that user kind of sees as soon as he lands page. So on landing page, we are saying conversational DevOps is the future. The future is here. I think this has been like review players, and it looks solid to me from a missing messaging positioning standpoint. And I asked you, shark, if it's possible to be like, can we show the conversational DevOps is the future as soon as that's already there, when the user is on the page, okay, he opens the page and he sees conversational DevOps, is it? And, like, maybe a split second later, the future is here will slowly show up, or some kind of electric effect or something. So that's what I asked. Yeah, you can we can do that during development, kind of cinematic effect, I guess. And I'm going to share this video recording with both Satish and Isha and even maybe Pawan, so that they understand what, what's the behind the scenes work that has been gone or that has been put in to come up with these like media content. Okay, so, and then the sub headline is transforming DevOps workflows through a conversations again. And at any point, if you want to stop and add your inputs, let me know, or else I'll keep going. And right now for here, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  16:39  
what can we just see how database the reason I'm saying is we're claiming that conventional conversational DevOps is the future and future is here. So when we pitch this website to users, are we missing something? I mean, are we not telling what is the problem that we are solving here? Or, since, I mean,

Swarup Donepudi  17:13  
every you don't have to put any disclaimers here saying this is no like you don't have to say it's just my feeling or anything. And the whole point of this conversation is to get your input out. So whatever you feel like, everything is valid point. So, so, yeah, this is so build and ship your software on single collaborator platform, is what GitHub has. Yeah? So,

Suresh Attaluri  17:39  
so that's the actual problem that these guys are solving. And co pilot or AI is a additional solution that convenience that they are giving through their product, right? Yeah, so same here in our case. Yes, we. We want that conversational thing to be highlighted, okay? But again, at the same point, I feel that it is more appealing to an investor than a customer when he wants to try this, try product. I don't know the actual intention is not to try conversational, AI, right? The actual intention for

Swarup Donepudi  18:28  
the reason for so that is what is all about, positioning, meaning, how do you want your customers to see? You see? Okay, so what are we is one, one way to think about it, right? I think there are at least 50 other companies who will have the same exact answer as we do. So that's, that's like we are saying the truth. You have 50 options. Now maybe it's, it's your pick, and then I so that is where right we are. We have been constantly iterating. And even for customers. Obviously, a is not the only word there. It's about conversational DevOps. DevOps is a thing

Suresh Attaluri  19:14  
I'm looking at value like the customers journey standpoint, like if I am a customer of plant and cloud, I won't start my journey looking for a conversational AI platform where I can conversational DevOps, a platform that would be my

Swarup Donepudi  19:34  
again, I think also, like, it's not, it's most likely not going To be like, again, this is something that I learned from both books and my own journey so far, which is, it is not going to happen that without us actually sending the link to somebody with us knowing their background and letting them know that we have built some solution. So there's already some context when somebody is already looking at this page, meaning we are solving so and so there is going to be a precon. It's not going to be like somebody is going for a solution and they land upon this solution, and they are going to sign up and subscribe. I think we are very far away from that. So at this point it's going to be like, who is whoever is going like, for example, we are going to post it on show Hacker News, right? We are going to tell them that, hey, we built so and so to solve so and so. Here is our prop website. Can you go and check it out? Okay? So that that is how you bring people in, which is you explain something to people, and they, if they are interested, they'll come check it out. So this GitHub is different. Again, we cannot direct, do a direct comparison, because they are well established platform, and it is, I don't even know if people come here and see this and actually buy it, because GitHub is that big right now, they just put it, I guess, put something there. I wonder what was, what is it that they put on like their first launch?

Suresh Attaluri  21:18  
So how I'm looking at that hero section is. Hero section is the first thing that we want anyone to know about, plant and cloud.

Swarup Donepudi  21:29  
No, I want. I mean, not I want. Hero section is not the place where people learn about the product itself. Hero section is the place where they find the most special thing about that, thing that it is solved. So we the our previous version is internal developer platform, right? And everything is generic term. There is nothing catchy, nothing. And this is a sales website, right So, and even here, join the world's most widely adopted, AI powered developer platform. This can have any number of meanings today. Developer platforms can have any number of and internal developer platform, I think, because of the number of competitors or solutions that have come up already. And also, there is a risk to that word itself, because the word itself is like relatively new to the market. DevOps has been there for a very long time. So that is very universal. DevOps is very universal. And that, that was one of the reason why we chose that word, A is also universal today. Whereas you put platform engineering or internal developer platform, even within the community, people are trying to learn what the word is like. For example, if I tell deep, who has been in like DevOps for a while, she would be like, what is an internal platform, so that that's like a huge risk right now. So if we want some kind of attention, we don't want to use those technical terms that truly reflect the product today, right? And for me, that it's, it's now it's not going, definitely not going to be like you. People will start searching for it. These will be like sales led conversations, meaning outreach. We go we put it on Hacker News, we put it on platform, engineering, Slack channel, and we say, this is what we do, and then we lead people into it. So now, when they come in, what is that we want to, like, surprise them with, or get their attention immediately. By the time they come here, they all we know, because somebody told them that, hey, here is something that we built to solve some problem. Can you, like, try it out,

Suresh Attaluri  24:06  
and conversational DevOps is the future. Yeah?

Conversations so I see DevOps, again, a generic word, but here we are showing in the GIF, I think we need to show what is that we are doing, right, like the request here in the plan chart is I need a Eks cluster, create a new Eks cluster. But the GIF is not completed, I think so we can add something where it is being deployed, and also, I'm sure that it is already deployed in the AWS

Swarup Donepudi  25:03  
Okay, side of Yeah, I think I asked even in chef, he basically took it from whatever was on figma already. I told him to give better conversation. Yeah, glad on the video behind the hero section, yeah, that tells a lot about the story. Yeah. And what should that be? These are the tough questions, actually. So now getting if Yeah, it is totally true that if the conversation can be more relevant and can convey a more bigger story in a short time. That's awesome. That's great. The tough part is, and the important part right now is to go for one step further and discuss and finalize what those should be concretely. And what do you think?

Suresh Attaluri  26:03  
Same thing. I need new eks. I need to create new Eks cluster. Okay, that is a starting point. Yeah. And then, like in right now, the implemented version of plant and plant over will give a prompt saying, I will need these certain inputs to create AK,

Swarup Donepudi  26:23  
all of that here in this background. Okay, I don't know if the about the technical implementations these, these are very large files. Okay, for some reason, without 4k rendering, he was able to, like, squeeze it into like, 15 MB or something

Suresh Attaluri  26:44  
like that. So let's keep the prompt. User will ask, I need a Eks cluster, and that will trigger a Stackdriver will show the

Swarup Donepudi  26:54  
Okay, we'll try it out. I don't know. Again, limitations of what can Sameer put there within those technical exercise limitations. So the story that we want to say is even, yeah, stack job again. I think we you and I have been so close to this product. We think multi cloud deployments is the only thing in the product so far, and I think we are still stuck there. The very first thing that comes to mind is, again, deploy something and then stack job. I'm just critical questioning here. I'm pushing beyond which is, is that DevOps? Is that, will that truly represent,

Unknown Speaker  27:39  
yeah, the DevOps perspective.

Swarup Donepudi  27:42  
So this is from insider perspective, right? That is what we feel like showing, because we feel like that's the that's like 80% of time we spent, and that's like 80% of the core of the product. So we want to show that, but that doesn't mean that is DevOps, right? So that is where I'm questioning, like I won't deploy something, and then showing a pulumi stack within the chat, okay? It seems like divorce, again, just critical question, yes or no, yeah, even I am on the same page as you, because we both are, like, so close to the product, right? I can't even, I can't think of anything, anything. So maybe we'll try with Samir,

Suresh Attaluri  28:30  
or forget about stack job blocks. We can just show that AKs cluster a message is sent to plant, or they create an Eks cluster. Next response that you get is, Eks cluster has been created, yeah, if possible, we can. We can. Another view is the AWS side of it being created.

Swarup Donepudi  28:58  
Yeah, I think that all of that is not necessary. This is what I kind of got stuck in for a very long time, which is you want to tell as big of a story as possible all the time, like the complete stories, but understand that there is more, right? So we have more. So in that case, it is not necessary that it the story need to be told here and the user is going to show the page.

Suresh Attaluri  29:22  
One thing we can do is conversational DevOps. If you ask something,

Swarup Donepudi  29:28  
yeah, that, I think that that so far that these two things align, except that there is no response. There is no

Suresh Attaluri  29:35  
response, yeah, that's, that's one. Oh, there is actually so I can, it says that I can assist you, but, but that is

Swarup Donepudi  29:44  
that is also good to me, to me that is better meaning it is having a conversation versus saying I want a headache. It Right.

Suresh Attaluri  29:57  
In that case, how about we ask the we show that prompt as well. Like, if you need to create an Eks cluster, give me

Swarup Donepudi  30:05  
these Yeah, because you can expand on that, and you add more quality to the response. Saying yeah, if I can get so instead of saying a basic one, we can say yeah. You can give me the VPC or some advanced input, rather than like basic question and answer to let people know that this is an advanced bot. It's not like

Suresh Attaluri  30:26  
a very it has that all intelligence to pass on to the provider, collect the information, pass on to the provider. Yeah, so I mean, it will have that sense of guided journey to the customer to user as well. Yeah, you don't need to worry about what has to be provided. So

Swarup Donepudi  30:52  
four message team, yeah, we can also probably, like, remove some of these are, like, nice graphics, I know

Suresh Attaluri  31:01  
the canvas thing can be removed, yeah, and only planned on,

Swarup Donepudi  31:08  
yeah. I think that's better experience. Definitely. This adds more elegance to the quality of the website. Obviously, it is not useful for conveying some message there. Presentation wise, it has, like, some type of effect. But yeah, we can, we can try things out overall, the to the to conclude the hero section, we want also, do you want to add a button to say, Watch video right here. Or as the user scrolls to the next section, we can here, we can add a video thumbnail. So again, going back to the Okay, yeah, maybe I should do that. I'm opening github.com once again. So as you scroll next, right? This is where they were. They already did GIF,

Unknown Speaker  32:05  
yeah, if you see here,

Swarup Donepudi  32:08  
yeah. So that's why, that's why I'm telling the hero section doesn't have to tell the full story, full story. We are breaking down the stories, and we are providing the access to those stories, making them accessible where, in like, right after the hero section. It's not like he has to spend another five minutes and navigate and so, yeah, we can tell more stories outside the hero section to you. In fact, if you see GitHub, you know they don't have anything he

Suresh Attaluri  32:39  
was so the gift thing, they don't have it again.

Swarup Donepudi  32:45  
Every designer has their own touch. So we didn't ask for it if showed it to us, and it's, it's kind of fancy and nice, better than GitHub, I feel like, or at least like, given that we are a startup, we want to, like, create a first impression saying, Oh, these guys, people judge us because we are India Indians. There is also that meaning we represent low quality engineering, but we are, like, going back all band with, like, some flashy animation. So I want to keep that part, but improve the conversation with probably more relevant response. But yeah, if you see GitHub, even this was my idea, as the user scrolls to the top, we we now, even if you see here, this is a GIF. You can play, but you can't. You can play or pause, but you cannot do forward or remind. And it has these and these. I think this is also part of the same thing that it shared, the written, the hero element. All of this is probably Adobe effects. This

Suresh Attaluri  33:52  
looks more real or more Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  33:57  
yeah. This can be, which can be our full screen screen recording, yeah, and then the chat begins here, and then it can be expanded

Unknown Speaker  34:06  
that has that feeling of more animated, yeah? That's

Swarup Donepudi  34:10  
not for showing the entire conversations. That is more for, like showing animated, fancy stuff, yeah? And even, even there, right? There is some definitely conversational DevOps, and there is a chat bot, and somebody is writing something, and bot is responding back. So conversational DevOps and something related to DevOps. So I think all of that actually fits good. We can make we

Suresh Attaluri  34:39  
remove the canvas. Okay, we'll have a chart. We still have the chart user will be typing instead of two messages that there's one message from user, one message from client, or make it a four message

Swarup Donepudi  34:51  
thing, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  34:56  
and we'll end it there for the animated one. Okay, so since the only reason that is we are not talking about Canvas here, and without giving the canvas context, also, I don't know how relevant is Canvas on this I a hero section, yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  35:29  
even I don't know, and just thinking, how would it look with just chat box, meaning the overall animation? We have to see how, what Sameer can come up with. Like, if you see, he grew us into that chat conversation with some kind of animation. I relate that to other like movie trailers or like Game of Thrones. They show the important part, but they move the camera over something where I'm not really paying attention to the detail, but the animated effect is taking me somewhere and like the creating that build up, yeah, exactly, yeah. So creating that build up and then showing me that thing versus June, here is the most important thing. That is what I thought Samir was trying to accomplish. I think this is actually a standard effect that he didn't, he most likely didn't come with the whole concept of this build up, and I'm showing this. It's probably an Adobe After Effects thing where people do these kind of patterns, but will itself. Is going to watch this. So he will probably get a get what we feel and and see even we didn't even ask for this.

Suresh Attaluri  36:40  
Do you remember that those gifs we used to get in Excel with the old Excel Help Text, they used to be these icons coming up on our Excel or Word document, okay? And when we click on them, that's when they used to open a chart and we used to enter us. Okay? So, okay, I think let's leave the creative part to do this. My idea, or my thought was, we'll have some small plantora thing jumping up here. Okay, have an effect of clicking it, and it will get open and then all that chat happening,

Swarup Donepudi  37:21  
yeah, for me again, from the standpoint of making progress, there is so many decisions we need to make, so and we are going to have V twos and V threes. And important goal for us right now is to fill up most of these voids and roll it out because see, okay, what's our next important journey is have those conversations, right whether or not we have the greatest animation or not the greatest animation, what is going to block the conversations is actually the readiness of the website, not the awesome, awesome, like the most awesome website, which is ready, yeah, but there is a middle ground. Meaning, why did we do one page with like, one hero section and one login and, well, we don't want to do that. So I think this is already, like, ultra step improvement from what we then we task for it, right? We only wanted this. All of this is the shots creation, or something is creation. So we are now. We are greedy people, obviously. So we want, like, more from what's already there. So what I propose is, like, we let that creativity part to them, and we'll let them know that, hey, we want to highlight the conversation, DevOps conversation, DevOps part, and we want to give a better conversation. Yeah, better conversation. It's not like a Hello World thing. We want to show something advanced to let people assume that it's an advanced bot. It's not like a Hello World bot because a lot of people are also talking about it. And based on our experience, we learned that doing the Hello World is easy, but doing something advanced is tough, and I think we are overthinking that can also be possible, okay, so as the use of

Suresh Attaluri  39:28  
scroll. So one, one change that we decide of Hero, Hero section is this animation?

Swarup Donepudi  39:33  
Yeah, only animation, not animation. We are not expecting experts in animation. What is that we want to convey? Is what we decided we let the animation modifications to which happens somewhere, and what is the modification that we want here is a better conversation, okay? And I think it's a long conversation already, so we'll revisit this page tomorrow, where I mean, you can you, and I can think about it, and probably finally, come with those three or four conversation exchanges, and we need to update the requirements doc for initial and Bucha is going to do that, okay, so that's still to do for us, okay? And so this part is all like, neat, no changes, just the conversation part. And as the user scrolls, yeah. So this is where we are actually showing what we want the users to know. So this, this is actually called as, what I called it as, as problem definition section, okay, so the hero section is for, like, the boom, like something that you don't hear elsewhere. And okay, now let me without wasting a lot of time, let me explain what is that we built and we are trying to solve. And that is where the problem definition comes in, and it says setting the gold standard for internal developer platforms in fast paced world of software development, etc. Before that,

Suresh Attaluri  41:00  
how about we add a video or any form of content,

Swarup Donepudi  41:04  
Yeah, same thing, right? Same thing as GitHub, right? For like

Suresh Attaluri  41:07  
this one this, they have created this GIF, but we can add video also right at the hero section itself, we can add a video link or a small video thumbnail

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
that I mean? Why? Why not this

Unknown Speaker  41:26  
below section? Okay,

Swarup Donepudi  41:28  
so, so there is already an introduction here.

Suresh Attaluri  41:31  
The reason for this is this GIF looks complicated, and then talking with you,

Swarup Donepudi  41:36  
no in place of GIF will have video. Video, yeah, yeah. Same exact thing, easy, same exact play button, yeah. But it's going to be a video with audio, with, like, the full fledged story that we want to tell.

Suresh Attaluri  41:52  
Like, we can, we can show them. I mean, we can create and show,

Swarup Donepudi  41:56  
I think, triple dot, triple screen sharing. Tuple, the best remote page. Tuple, dot app. Tuple, dot app. You see come here. So, okay, actually, these guys probably have modified it. So two years ago, when we started, okay, this page had the creator of the founder, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  42:22  
a small video, right, yeah. But if you see here, this looks like a screen recording, only you can have similar thing, right, like, Yeah, this is GIF.

Swarup Donepudi  42:33  
Oh, is it, yeah? This is it will keep repeating itself. You see, same thing came. They modify, but screen record. No screen recordings can be converted to chips, right? But this is not a video of what I'm saying, because you don't hear audio. There

Suresh Attaluri  42:48  
are two types of chips, one which is created, which is right now,

Swarup Donepudi  42:54  
that is not even if that is video that also has already audio, it's so okay. That's being played in the browser, there is a sound icon also,

Suresh Attaluri  43:01  
okay, so, but the way it is created itself, yeah, they use some tag, I mean, which requires attention towards what

Swarup Donepudi  43:13  
you're saying. So ask this. We won't ask if

Suresh Attaluri  43:17  
shad we it's not required to be a high quality videos, simple screen recording.

Swarup Donepudi  43:24  
That is, that is why I have this GIF Fox ready. Okay, so, so that is, I shared a few gifs in the past, also, right. So,

Unknown Speaker  43:31  
let's use that.

Swarup Donepudi  43:33  
That's why I mentioned when we say, here we can, we can create these GIFs with screen recordings also, okay. In fact, that is the only thing we can do. Or I told you that the gib can also be created with iPad recording, where we want to explain some connections between some things. And it can also be both, by the way, okay. And

Suresh Attaluri  43:55  
I see this pattern that they're not fully exposing this section on the hero, on the hero, yeah?

Swarup Donepudi  44:01  
But then as you scroll up now, you see that part, yeah, we'll let it shall know about that. Even this one is same story. And when it comes to ours, yeah, the first part is not showing what is next, yeah, like in I think that's something for inshallah and and we'll make sure this part directly shows videos. And I like the way GitHub has multiple of these actually. So you say this part, right? Yeah. So here it says, build code quickly and more securely this thing, and that is what they are explaining here. And you switch this, it changes so in plan, so we can come up with sections here. These

Suresh Attaluri  44:47  
are the actual products screens

Swarup Donepudi  44:52  
we can this is what I told you. Said that this is what I want as the second part. Yeah, because, as I said, we want this. We want to throw as much useful content as possible for users to understand the capabilities of the product or

Suresh Attaluri  45:08  
the hero section itself. Everything is, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  45:11  
yeah. So we are leveraging the hero section to, like, tell the biggest asset we have, right, even from a customer standpoint, right? A DevOps, to me, is a customer thing, not just investor thing. Reason is my own experience of like all of one, I keep exploring products to solve various problems, right? Customer, I'm not an investor in anything, but I'm looking for a solutions. If there is no AI, meaning I have to do more work. And I'm like, Why don't they leverage AI and solve this problem in any way? So that is why we were, like, telling that story, and the animation part is to, like, tell the world that we are not like poor quality roadside guys like, create a good global brand, okay, and immediately bring them to the videos part, which is, now, let's educate them. Okay, so here, okay, so getting close to one hour will continue tomorrow, but tomorrow you will begin with, what kind of what are these alternatives in our own case, like code, plan, collaborate, automate and secure, if you, if you see that tells GitHub story, yeah, GitHub code

Suresh Attaluri  46:44  
one thing that I'm noticing here is they don't have co pilot. The co pilot thing came up recently, right? Yeah, but they are highlighting that only the code is code part is their actual product in a plan, collaborate, automated, secure or not, are not or are not the primary features. They had code, but there's showing code. They're showing the cooperating,

Swarup Donepudi  47:14  
I think, yeah, repositioning, right? You will always have so constantly iterate in your My

Suresh Attaluri  47:18  
first question when I asked why to highlight conversational AI, I think we are also doing Yeah, same thing,

Swarup Donepudi  47:27  
yeah. That's what people will learn about what we do within like first maybe three, four seconds or like, as they scroll to the next part. And as I said, no one is going to visit our website without them being brought there with some initial context. And people will only go there if they like the context, and if they if they have a problem in that area, in that space. Okay, so, yeah, tomorrow, it's a 48 minute recording already tomorrow we are going to start with, how do we want to construct this? I don't know what to call this. GitHub writes it as coaches, plan, collaborate, automate, secure. No, it's actually it feels like a sentence, read it, read it in sequence. Okay? Code, plan, collaborate, automate, secure, like it's like a sentence works, put in sequence, right? So we can come up with something similar. What you can do with plant and Pro Plan number, I think that's, yeah, exactly the aim of the that is the theme here, right? What can you do with GitHub is you can code, plan, collaborate, automate and secure, cool. I think in our case also, we can definitely do yes, yeah. I see collaborate, yeah, Bootstrap, build, deploy, yeah, and then operate. Day to Ops is a big thing. And in fact, day two Ops is actually a pretty big thing. We kind of built Kubernetes features and then eventually called it day two ops, right? But I've seen Day Two plus operations as a big deal in a lot of conversations. So I think we can do something like that on that. Maybe audit we'll see. So we'll continue tomorrow. I think this is good conversation. I finally feel like we can make progress, because I'm getting action items from each of these, like, if I know what to record, what GIFs to create, what should be the story within that gif, I have the tools I can clearly capture them and finalize them quickly. So sure, cool. Thank you, Suresh, thank you so much for your time. Yeah. Thank you Swarup. First long procedure.

## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/01-landing-page/landing-page.p2.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:00  
Okay, going back. So good swap, build, deploy, deploy, deploy. Build will have a conversation with plantor saying, Hey, can you add GitHub actions to my repository to set up build automation for building and, yeah, the same things that we talked about. Then deploy, then it will conversation. Hey, I want to deploy my service. I will ask, where is your repository? And then it says, Would you like to deploy to Kubernetes? It will say, yes, okay, what is your name of the service? And it will show the micro service thing and, or maybe it can be as simple as, okay, I have added GitHub a pull request to add this thing, and the pull request screenshot will show customize and something like that, right? Okay, so, so far, Bootstrap, build and deploy. Yeah, these three

Speaker 1  0:53  
commanders service category of building and deploy, right? Yeah, provisioning. There is nothing we are talking about provisioning. By provisioning, I mean

Swarup Donepudi  1:05  
infrastructure that, yeah, that we require true to build. So this is now we are getting into the the domain of internal development platforms, where the idea is, there is platform engineering group, and then there is developer group. So platform engineering group does a certain set of things, and developers do certain things, but all of them, the end goal is to make sure the black whatever platform engineering does, they'll enable self service for developers. Okay, so what is it that platform engineering teams do within the companies is allow developers to bootstrap services, deploy monitor, set up monitoring, or whatever right operate so they can do that all by themselves. Platform engineering, on the other hand, will make sure they are setting up infra they are sharing, like allowing the environments to go use those info. So, so maybe we can have two journeys as our own, like unique proposition, whether you are platform engineer or whether you are a developer, if you are a platform engineer, then provision and probably share or configure, I don't know, or do you want a single train here, like provision?

Suresh Attaluri  2:35  
Yeah, provision, code, provision,

Swarup Donepudi  2:37  
bootstrap

Speaker 1  2:39  
provision is the first thing that happens, right? Yeah. Provision, build, deploy, sorry. Provision, Bootstrap, build and deploy. Yeah, I'll write those up here. Let's write all those

Swarup Donepudi  2:58  
now. Those will be created by chatgpt automatically

Speaker 1  3:00  
later, we can filter few if we can interact. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  3:05  
so, provision, Bootstrap, build,

Suresh Attaluri  3:12  
deploy, deploy.

Swarup Donepudi  3:17  
So here we have, I mean, our platforms, capabilities. You can deploy services, you can deploy open source, you can deploy managed services. So this is where multi cloud deployments come in, right?

Speaker 1  3:32  
So in that case, provision and this deploy are same,

Swarup Donepudi  3:36  
no provision has a different meaning. So you need for these services or open source to land, you're creating some infrastructure. So this is provisioning infrastructure, whereas these deployments, right? What is that that is done on a day to day basis, is for these services, they need open source software, and developers would be in management services like s3 buckets or whatever. So this stage of deployment is only talking about deploying whatever is needed for services, and the provisioning step is talking about where the deployment setting up infra. So infra setting up in first environments. So yeah. In fact, this goes back the same story. Goes back to December 2022 or January 2023 when we submitted our first application to Y Combinator and we told the exact same story. The first step was provisioning a Kubernetes cluster. Second step was creating an environment. Third step was bootstrapping the repository. So we demonstrated all of that in like the 20 minute recording, right? And then we automated build which we called ahead magic pipeline, and which also confidence deployment. And then we did the day two operations, which is users were able to list parts and stream logs for I think just streaming logs was the only thing we did in our first version. But the story of narrative did change. It's just the implementation change over time. So yeah, we will see again. We don't have to, probably, like, nail down this thing, this journey, because this is all of this is being recorded as a conversation. We can also rely on chatgpt to help us understand what would make a proper journey. It would do a comparison of what is on GitHub, which is coding, planning, collaborating, automating and securing, and it will understand what plant on Cloud is about based on all of this conversation, and try to come up with its own set. And we get, we can do a comparison, yeah, go on.

Speaker 1  5:47  
So I think, yeah, provision, provision is deploying GK cluster at all this,

Swarup Donepudi  5:55  
yeah, maybe in deploy step itself, we can show, I want to also add a Redis survey, Redis to my service. And I want, I need an s3 bucket, okay, yeah, right, so, but I think those can be like screenshots here, right? Yes, we'll see this,

Speaker 1  6:19  
but I think we have clear definitions for these

Swarup Donepudi  6:22  
four, yeah. And then the next step is operate, which is what is called as day two plus operations. So here we are showing we are saying, Can you give me parts, these parts?

Speaker 1  6:39  
So this is only specific to Google, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  6:43  
but we want to make sure, yeah, that's fine. We will probably we are not trying to win the entire world by saying we do everything right now. I think the main core selling point that we are trying to achieve with this new sales website is we want to help the visitors understand the core problem that we are solving, so which they can get with this. So we are claiming DevOps at the start, and then we are saying setting the gold standard for Internet developer platforms. And then these labels and the content here will probably either tell the visitor that it is either for them or not for them. It's my, oh, I came here to order food, but it looks like this is all related to software engineering, so he goes out, so something like that. Okay, so, so operate, yeah, we set Kubernetes pods streaming logs,

Speaker 1  7:37  
and there's action of operators to show the Kubernetes law. Or maybe we

Swarup Donepudi  7:42  
can also say something like, can you take a backup of my RDS database? So this is something, again, that is in our pipeline, an operational task, yeah, So day two plus ops itself is actually starting to take its own shape. I mean, I wrote up some kind of architecture and design around it, meaning, so we did Kubernetes data ops, right? So that seems like a foundation, which is, which is what I can think of like going back in the time the pulumi module automation enabled us, and we are calling today that as a multi cloud deployment framework. So it evolved, right? So Kubernetes integrations that are whatever we did in starting from like early days and now they stood slowly evolving to become a much bigger abstraction called day two operations. And we can call them plant and product actions. We can let developers define what those actions are. We define the framework. So there is a lot that's and even I've seen it in other platforms that they are calling, like HashiCorp waypoint. They call it as Golden workflows. Okay, so they believe that once you deploy, you want to do day two operations on what's deployed. Yes. Examples are, while Kubernetes, listing parts is one thing you want to restart. A part is another thing. So platform engineers need to develop these self service capabilities for day two and beyond. And those are not only for Kubernetes. Those can be for anything which is, can you take give me a backup for my RDS database? Can you scale my service to so and so? So these are all like day two, plus actions. So operate comes under that thing. So what we are going to claim on the website, we will get to that when we get there provision

Speaker 1  9:34  
or deploy those things, which you initially do. And there are certain operations you would like any DevOps engineer

Swarup Donepudi  9:43  
or any developer developer would needs to do for their own service beyond deployment. So there, that is where we are calling it as operate, operate and monitor. Monitor is like so deploy, monitor, operate or deploy, operate, monitor, whatever the order can be, anything monitor is like, can you add like, set up an alert for this service. Is capability that users want. So we're not doing it right now. We will eventually, but not not right now. So we can say we don't have to, because if we want to tell a story, we can say operate, but we can say coming soon. But it is 100% sure that it is it has to land on this internal developer platform, because without it, it's not a complete story. They need to go so developers are not capable of observing like setting up observability for their own app, and that's a big gap. So for Internet developer platforms, these are, like, necessary, and we are, like, adding a nice layer on top of that with conversational interfaces that is, like the product that I've been thinking about. So yeah, I think these are getting really good, like provision, Bootstrap, build and deploy, or whatever, automate and operate and monitor or observe. Monitor or monitor is good? Monitoring, observing? Yeah, we'll let chatgpt also decide some of these. So I think I'll work with you to first create this element, yes, and then we will work with on each of those to finalize the screenshots or any recording or tips will again pair with your share on that. I think that that's

Suresh Attaluri  11:36  
like,

Swarup Donepudi  11:41  
oh, okay, yeah. So the story that we are saying selling on our own website, if you go back to this thing, so features, plan Dora, which is like the conversational self service DevOps,

Speaker 1  11:57  
that's the provisioning, bootstrapping, build and deploy. Everything

Swarup Donepudi  12:01  
is self service, yeah, and then service hub, service, that is where, like you can see all the services, etc. So, okay, are we telling it in that story is discover, is what I think it's hard for us to probably put it in

Speaker 1  12:26  
integrated ISC workflows. Well, when you say integrated IAC workflows, are those stack jobs,

Swarup Donepudi  12:31  
right? Yeah, like meaning you make a configuration change or you want to deploy something, something you workflow automatically kicks kicks off. So, yeah. So

Suresh Attaluri  12:41  
can we put

Swarup Donepudi  12:45  
more customers

Speaker 1  12:48  
and highlight that have these real time logs coming up?

Swarup Donepudi  12:54  
So this one is a section title, so this one has its own media,

Suresh Attaluri  13:01  
so that is a feature, right, like

Swarup Donepudi  13:05  
so this is right. So here you will show those log streaming, pulumi plan or TerraForm.

Speaker 1  13:13  
What is that user is actually? User is getting with these logs. That's what is like with self service DevOps. User is able to provision infra. User is able to bootstrap and deploy, yeah, and operate also. But can we think of a word if we say, if we show these logs. Just if we can't, then we'll move on.

Swarup Donepudi  13:45  
Yeah, I am having a hard time understanding the exact point you are trying to highlight here, which is, so what is that? Again, it goes back to this this itself, this structure itself. Okay, so I think I told you about I wanted to begin with yesterday, begin with the structure that we wanted to come with in establishing this content, right? So we took inspiration from GitHub, right? Again, that was the fund of our success, which is take one reference and build arrow, right? So this is what. So when you say actions, can you now, can you rephrase your question, aligning that with what GitHub is

Speaker 1  14:37  
saying, right? Yeah, actions is the feature. What is that user is going to get? Is user is going to automate their workflows, right? So that's why they have mapped that actions with this automate true thing. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  14:52  
so in our in our case, so if you go scroll on top features, and I integrated IAC workflows, preview and pulumi, this is our sponge line, whereas their punch line is automate workflows.

Speaker 1  15:11  
So can we derive a word for IAC workflows so that we can add next to these provisions? I mean

Swarup Donepudi  15:19  
Ise workflows is comparable to actions in meetup. Like if we take things, we took we are not innovating there, we took one strong inspiration. So everything that we did, we tried to find counterparts for great thing. So

Speaker 1  15:35  
can we also use a category as automate and and demo these ISC workflow. ISC workflows, I mean, along with all these,

Swarup Donepudi  15:50  
okay, again, going back to GitHub reference. So important to note that this are not aligned with the rest of the page. So here they are telling one story, and if and now going case if you screen keep scrolling down, they are disconnected now, meaning so they they resorted to explaining each of these, but not in conjunction with this. So yeah, like So these tend to be more like their features, core features, okay, here they are telling one narrative, one complete narrative, like you can use GitHub to do code plan collaborate, automate, secure,

Speaker 1  16:36  
done, but each of these, code plan, collaborate, automate and secure is associated with a feature,

Swarup Donepudi  16:44  
right? But, but that they are not map, establishing a map between those like, for example, take,

Speaker 1  16:53  
like, Code Spaces like, I know automate is mapped with actions. Now, if you click on that also, you'll see they're talking about actions only, okay, you're talking about a feature. Okay, go on Similarly, when we look at code, we're talking about their co pilot thing, okay, plan, whether they're talking about their feature of something called issues, yeah, this one.

Swarup Donepudi  17:17  
Plan, no, that's not issues. That's a plan is not here, okay?

Speaker 1  17:32  
And collaborate. They're using those words discussions, those discussions are using it as collaborate, okay, yeah, certain features, they don't, they might not feel as important, so they haven't included,

Swarup Donepudi  17:45  
yeah, that's, that is the core point that I'm trying to establish, even in our case, which is, we, these are not directly doing this. They are related in some way. You can, we can draw like relationships, I'm pretty sure so. And I can do, I can also do the same thing for our own which is, like, we didn't, we are talking about this workflow, right? We didn't have that

Speaker 1  18:11  
workflow like this. COVID is dashboard. We can map it to operate, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  18:15  
IAC workflows, mapping it to automate, automate.

Speaker 1  18:19  
That's the whole point. We can add it to this list, right? Automate is a new category,

Swarup Donepudi  18:26  
or we do it for both, yeah, or so we brainstorm on the possibility of combining these two to become automate. Automate. But IAC workflows itself is related to these two things in our own like system, but we are kind of splitting this journey to tell a

Speaker 1  18:44  
story. Yeah, they can be explained in these two categories, also, provision, yeah, build and deploy. So, yeah, if we think that it can be covered in these two then it's fine.

Swarup Donepudi  18:58  
This stuff is somewhat closer to this story. Obviously, planter a is a is our sales tool. So that cannot, you cannot map any of its actually going to be applying

Speaker 1  19:11  
to all, all of these, yeah, but we are not explicitly mentioning Yeah. This

Swarup Donepudi  19:16  
only falls for,

Speaker 1  19:19  
also falls in the same category, where it has all these categories. What? Okay, what about self

Swarup Donepudi  19:27  
service DevOps, again, falls for everything. Service hub is for Bootstrap, build and deploy and maybe discover. Discovery, something that we are missing, which is on internal developer platforms. One of the core values that you get is you get your new developer. Sorry, onboarding new developers.

Suresh Attaluri  19:45  
Your discover. Discover is

Swarup Donepudi  19:49  
you want to know, what are all the list of services your organization has? Who is the owner of that? Where is it being deployed? What is the health of those? Etc, etc. Is all the information put in a central place for you to discover. So that is our service.

Okay? So that is where we are saying bootstrap will also

Suresh Attaluri  20:17  
discover the Discover point, I think a bootstrap

Swarup Donepudi  20:19  
Build and Deploy. Yeah, here we are not, do we? I don't know how many it is going to get to. Okay. So far we have provision Bootstrap, and maybe we can combine some of these also provision discover, but

Speaker 1  20:38  
we can all we can prepare the list right we can always exclude, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  20:43  
so, so we can add discover to this train right now. And this is related to allowing either new team members or existing team members to learn about the all the services that exist within the organization, etc. That is what we call it as service hub, which is streamline your Bucha, creation, all your services, one hub. So this is the vocabulary,

Speaker 1  21:12  
but that will also discover will also our quick action functionality. Using our quick action functionality, users will be able to discover what is the ready. I mean, if there is a Redis instance, it's not only applicable for micro services.

Swarup Donepudi  21:32  
In fact, I recently thought about our own like thought of service hub, which doesn't only have to show the make these services. It can include these also, like this is also a service in a way. So, yeah, we can. So what is it that you're proposing here? No, I'm not,

Speaker 1  21:57  
I'm not proposing to modify anything about service. Okay, I'm saying when we talk about this, you can services

Speaker 2  22:06  
both Microsoft service. So I

Swarup Donepudi  22:10  
think it doesn't have to be by quick launch. It can actually be within service. Hub is, is my new proposal, which is we thought we will only do when it goes, go to service. It's all like in house built services. But you can also explore, oh, there is a Redis service running, and it is running, say, on Google memory, store, whatever. And here is who created it, but that's a service, but that actually probably, I think we have we added an annotation or an option to our API resource, kind to say, is service right? So we only did for micro service resource kind fargate, cloud run or something. Maybe we have to extend that to other places like Redis, Kafka. We need to identify them and surface them in service, right? Yeah, okay, so that's an action, but Okay, going back to these options, provision, bootstrap builder, deploy, operate, discover, monitor, monitor and

Speaker 1  23:21  
anything about I am, we can add here like,

Swarup Donepudi  23:26  
so we didn't claim that on the landing page, okay? It goes on the Features page the same so, and that also is put at the end. We can reorder this. Yeah. So, yeah, Team administration, management, blah, blah, blah, but yeah, again, I think these are, like, functional. It's not,

Speaker 3  23:48  
it's not, like, it's not the main, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  23:55  
you don't, you don't do just a permission management for the sake of accomplishing your goal of building software.

Speaker 1  24:02  
This is like, like what we said initially, the theme is what you can do on brand and cloud

Swarup Donepudi  24:09  
and that that will have a direct value proposition, like, provision has a direct outcome. Bootstrapping has an expectation, has a result. Billion deploy has an expectation as a result, but I am there is no clear expectation, like, what is it that you want to do in this process

Suresh Attaluri  24:27  
that's not the core functionality

Swarup Donepudi  24:30  
or value that you graduate you will need it just like login or sign up. You will eventually need proper ability to control or manage access between your resources. But that's not like I need it, without which I can deploy my software or make my software available to users. So

Suresh Attaluri  24:49  
anything else, if we want

Swarup Donepudi  24:51  
to put it, maybe it can have something like manage access or something, because I'm trying to build in words here to so manage access.

Speaker 1  25:05  
Can an agent team or managing access? Okay, you can manage your team. That's always

Swarup Donepudi  25:10  
manage teams is not what is the goal we are even we are offering, right? We provided teams to enable access management, okay,

Speaker 1  25:23  
yeah, managing access. Of these, manage access, manage access. Cool. I think that's

Swarup Donepudi  25:32  
that's a good discussion. I think another 50 minute long discussion, and I'm pretty sure there is so much notes that can be covered, created, and I think we are still at the hero section, where we are we decided on one of the important aspects, what do you want to show the users on their first visit? That's a pretty big deal. And in the next discussion, we'll move forward with talking about each of these core features that we added here, yes, and talk about what, what are those? What is the media that we want to show it on, on the landing page so it doesn't have to be expensive, or maybe, maybe there will be a video where these, these don't have to be like graphical. The first parts will have to be graphical, whereas, as the user kind of starts to go down the page, we can just have a video where we are explaining our own app, what it does, right? And all of these, at least, are capable of demonstration today, except service of Bootstrap, launch. Everything else, we have a lot to show. So in the next section, we'll take one feature at a time, talk about, talk about, what should go on the landing page for that like, so what is it that you put a landing page is the overall value proposition of that particular feature, but each feature has its own dedicated this thing. Okay.

Speaker 1  27:20  
Yeah, so two things, what has to be there on the landing page under feature and

Swarup Donepudi  27:25  
yeah. And then there is a dedicated page for you. So and the hero element will may have the same video as as the media, but now going going for each of these, everything has a section title and section description, and here we want to show. We don't have to show a lot of videos. Now, if ever we feel like, okay, this this section, we can show something from the app, and that can be simple recording, but the goal of our conversation is to finalize those things, yes. So decide whether or not we want to show anything from the app at all, if it is a simple screenshot, or if it is from figma. Put it like, for example, high cost of waiting. This can also be just an animation, right? There is nothing on our app to show high cost of waiting. It's a story or value problem that we are saying. So this can be an animation like illustration outside graphic, and unleash the power of self service. So we say this thing again, do we want to put an animation here, or do we want to show something on our app? Recording stuff from our app is the easiest way to add media Everything else requires extra work. So we'll keep that in mind and we'll finalize. So we will do one feature for session going forward. Yeah. Okay. All right, I'm concluding the session here, it's another good discussion.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/01-landing-page/landing-page.p3.idp-illustration.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:09  
Okay, so first, let's go over the section where we highlight Kubernetes dashboard on the landing page. So the structure of this landing page itself is, you have the hero section and then followed by problem statement section, saying, This is what we do with the title. And this was primarily introduced to clearly say that we are we fall under internal development platform, because DevOps can mean many things, many platforms, and we want to highlight that this is an internal platform. So,

Suresh Attaluri  0:59  
so yeah, so is it considered as a feature?

Swarup Donepudi  1:02  
No, okay, yeah, this is something that we shall be eventually fix, but going back to this, so here, I told him that this is a problem definitions, okay, but he thought that it is feature. So what? There is not be anything here. Okay, so also, yeah, if

Suresh Attaluri  1:24  
we are defining a problem, definition here, internal developer platform is not not a problem, right? It is a solution.

Swarup Donepudi  1:35  
So what I mean by problem definition or statement definition is probably the problem with the title, but my intention was to say when, when we say, what is plant control? I would simply say it is an internal developer platform with your conversational capabilities, okay? So to establish the category and the product, what the product can be called as. That is why we added this section, but I put the title of the section as problem definition section.

Suresh Attaluri  2:13  
Okay, so if, if, if we are talking about problem definition, not solving DevOps bottlenecks or something,

Swarup Donepudi  2:23  
right? Yeah, so that that went into the first one on this, and then I think this one is breakthrough from DevOps bottleneck, etc. So, in a way, in a way, none of these titles were actually like carefully crafted. It's more like record talk and let chatgputi Give it a lot of context on like, Hey, we are for self service. Blah, blah, blah. Can you come up with a hero section, a few subsections based on the conversation? And finally, a Call to Action section. So we asked it to generate three hero sections so that we can, like, we can choose the best one that we feel might be relevant. So that is the iteration that we went through. So even in case of here, when we are doing the landing page, okay, the hero section is done, and we are saying, claiming a capabilities, but the actual platform itself is we have built an internal developer platform for so and so. Even though it says setting the gold standard for internal developer platforms, the title that chatgpt actually gave was kind of slightly different, it kind of summarized this, but I wanted to call it out that, like we are, well, we are solving software bottlenecks in software development in general. But the title I want to do something different with that by saying many people are building internal development platforms. And we are setting a gold standard, yeah, but this, this actually explains the problem. This is not

Suresh Attaluri  4:11  
a feature, okay, yeah, that's not a feature, but it tells about the product.

Swarup Donepudi  4:18  
Yeah, that's what it is product definition rather than problem definition, yeah, product definition, yeah. What is this product and, and I feel like this is my own belief, also, which is a lot of people are trying to build internet developer platforms. Yeah, right. For me, nothing stands out so far, we have the opportunity to, like, build something really good that people will find lot of strengths in the product. To say, hey, JIRA is what comes to my mind when we are thinking about project management. Similarly, Gmail comes to my mind because talking about opening open email. So quantum cloud zero comes to mind when I think about adding same login or sign up. Planta cloud comes to my mind when I'm thinking about internet. So that is the ultimate goal.

Suresh Attaluri  5:17  
And what is unified internal developer platform? We used that word unified, yeah, what does that even?

Swarup Donepudi  5:28  
I don't know. I think I replaced some word with internal platform, okay, okay, unified in plant on Cloud introduces a revolutionary approach, right? Integrating AI powered, conversational. Into a unified development platform. Again, I didn't, yeah, vocabulary like chatgpt, we didn't craft that's why I said we didn't craft those titles. Only made some modifications. I don't even if I did this. I don't think I did it, but,

Suresh Attaluri  6:03  
and next thing is, so that is a text that we get below. Yeah, this

Swarup Donepudi  6:10  
image. So these all images on the site that you see are samples taken by HR. Dump them, and he is, his expectation is, we will give him this. And that is the purpose of these conversations. So, yeah, this part that's for us to kind of so

Suresh Attaluri  6:30  
what I'm thinking is like, if we are saying this section is to say, what is our product all about? Yeah. So,

Swarup Donepudi  6:39  
so I felt like this. This one actually should have had this one, which is,

it is because her room is messing with

Suresh Attaluri  7:02  
I think dashboard is a nice place.

Swarup Donepudi  7:06  
Dashboard is not a nice place. I believe dashboard has nothing

Suresh Attaluri  7:13  
or canvas like showing all the resources. This might be a good element to go there.

Swarup Donepudi  7:22  
So it's not possible for us to show that we are internal developer platform. Okay by our dashboard, okay? Because when you see this, do you see an internal platform like obviously, we lived with these products for so long, I think we might. But bring some external person and

Suresh Attaluri  7:47  
how about, okay, we'll show, I thought this

Swarup Donepudi  7:49  
something like this. Okay, so you have plant uncloud in between.

Suresh Attaluri  7:54  
You're not showing the product, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  7:57  
So on one side you have discovery. On one side, you have Iam provisioning. On one side you have, like, the same story elements we wrote. You can provision, you can bootstrap, you can discover. You can set up, build and automation.

Suresh Attaluri  8:11  
We can add the design document, kind of something which we are doing on iPad, right? Like where Planning Cloud stands, where service

Swarup Donepudi  8:21  
itself can also design. This is when I saw this. I felt like, if I give him more icons and more text, he could definitely build something like this, because he did this. So that is what I feel like I should be on, because that is what we commonly see on other apps

Suresh Attaluri  8:39  
there. So how will we give it to his, sir? What is the form and

Swarup Donepudi  8:43  
share? So we have to give him a hand drawn sketch or a discussion, saying between and he needs concrete elements. Like, for example, when he drew this, he kind of came up with this, because when I gave him the this text for multi cloud page. I also asked chat GPT on, give, give some visual element help for my UX designer. So that included saying, put random code in between, in the middle, and put surrounded, because this is a multi cloud adoption page surrounded with some different cloud provider icons. So it gave that visual. Decided, similarly, we need to give him the concrete visual help, saying, Put plantain cloud in between and surround it with these elements. Can let service discuss those elements. So that is so when, in our current effort that we are doing, by the end of this discussion, we need to have this kind of nail down. That is one. So, yeah, we should. So the we can draw it out. Yeah,

it okay. So, can you take

a picture of that? I

Okay, so we are basically discussing,

is that okay, yeah, so we want to say it's an internal developer platform,

Suresh Attaluri  11:10  
yes,

Swarup Donepudi  11:13  
and because there is no single screenshot on our app that shows what is an internal developer platform? Now we need to come up with some ideas. And for that, I kind of showed you an inspiration based on what it should do, where we have p in the middle, Platinum code logo surrounded by what it does. So this is one way to do it, and another way to show it is your plan. Term in between where there is platform engineers and where there is devs like clearly solving what is meant to solve. Platform engineers will write IAC, write and publish IAC devs consume that IAC, and then maybe architects will write and publish templates. Devs consume those templates to boots have new services, so something like that, like and devs also kind of discover other services, discover Other services. Devs can do monitoring or operate, observe, operate, iterate, operate, observe something like that. So this is one way to look at it, like the parties that it is aimed to benefit by an internal developer platform solution.

Suresh Attaluri  12:54  
Yeah, I think this. This is, this tells more about internal developer platform, yeah, one which we have on the website, yeah. It says that one is more of multi cloud, multi cloud, multi cloud, and this one is more of how internet developer platform is used by other

Swarup Donepudi  13:14  
okay. Yeah. So this can be they

Suresh Attaluri  13:18  
can deploy services, they can build servers. Can do, yeah?

Swarup Donepudi  13:21  
So it's surrounded around devs, yeah, I think we can do something like we can ask as a bird also, yeah, we can ask to come up with some type of infographic where there are devs, there are devs as a group on one side, and there are platform engineers on another side, a group of platform name, and there is platinum cloud here, and We can show something like this, where we tell what they can do, what they each phone can do. And here also something like each line tells one story, like new services, configure, set up, CICD, deploy, operate, discover,

Suresh Attaluri  14:25  
monitor. So basically, what internal developer platform does is this thing, right? What happens if London cloud is not there? Let us say, discover, yeah, if landing cloud is not there. This developer will directly reach out, to reach out to this guy, and this platform engineering group has to inform them, if you can also draw those lines, what before and

Swarup Donepudi  14:55  
after? Kind of a thing, before and after, also in other places, like without, and that is also a good option, definitely. So clearly showing in this,

Suresh Attaluri  15:09  
if we have drawing lines till we have been having a solid line and then a dotted line representing that, if this, if Planning Cloud is not there, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  15:20  
this can also be a GIF, right? Like, for example, this is where like, creativity comes in, yeah, like the we are trying to get into how it should happen, whereas we need to probably just focus on what needs to happen? Let probably give it a try. We tell him the narrative, but what he definitely requires is a clear instruction. So he cannot take a concept and bring visualization. He can take a clear instruction. Can

Suresh Attaluri  15:58  
we do a quick Google search for internal developer platforms, how, what is if there is any presentation of an internal developer platform?

Speaker 1  16:22  
So jump on to the thing this way.

Swarup Donepudi  16:59  
I look at how many, number of people?

I'm just opening the ones that I think had some better infographic I remember

Speaker 1  17:20  
you telling about some blog where someone was explaining about this internal developer platform. I

Swarup Donepudi  17:57  
yeah, here you see without COVID. Dev talks to ops and with Corey. Dev, no, this is a nice representation. Dev talks to COVID and ops talks to Corey, and Corey manages this. Only one DevOps needed with Corey. That's the message that we are trying to show. Yeah, this is one good reference, and this is for landing page first. Oh, we started off the discussion to talk about the Kubernetes dashboard, and we jumped on to the landing page. Keep going for the landing first, finalize the

Speaker 1  18:45  
land, finalize the that section of landing page. Yeah, let's

Suresh Attaluri  18:51  
scope it that way. Do

Swarup Donepudi  19:08  
you see here the COVID folks, government, governance and custom policies. This is what they want to share say on their app, and they put a random meaning with this policies and government tools, and they put some Same, same as us, right? But for others, they will have some video, yeah, so this is directly loom video,

Suresh Attaluri  19:37  
yeah, you can do that also.

Swarup Donepudi  19:40  
For a few they are doing just a screenshot. For few, they are doing like a loom, video embedded, yeah, and the loom gives a GIF. So this is also interactive. Self Service integrations,

Speaker 2  19:58  
environment provisioning. CL, CLI, API,

Speaker 1  20:15  
I think that is good, right before and after. Thing

Swarup Donepudi  20:19  
can we find out? This is another way I thought about,

Suresh Attaluri  20:24  
yeah, but this talks about no integration and multi cloud enabled.

Swarup Donepudi  20:32  
Multi cloud, this is like everything you can do, source control, yeah, you can do infrastructure. You can do monitoring, so they put it in our case,

Suresh Attaluri  20:41  
we can put these things right, like that with before and after difference. Go to

Suresh Attaluri  20:52  
that screenshot.

Suresh Attaluri  20:59  
Before and After thing. Here they are not explaining why. What is the purpose? Right? Like each line, you can say, sir, that dev wants to build a project. They used to go to ops, but now they want to build a project. Then they will. They come to this guy.

Swarup Donepudi  21:19  
So they're saying Dev, stop talk, but we dev talks to ops, but they are not now, talks to Corey. Ops also talks to COVID and Corey takes care of managing this

Suresh Attaluri  21:35  
same way, which which we have all drawn, but there will be two diagrams. Yeah. We are mentioning that. We'll also mention the purpose of the reason why a platform engineer or ops engineer will talk to

Swarup Donepudi  21:50  
we can also do that if needed, if we can, like, for example, what is it that platform doing is like, this is a bad claim that I don't want to do on our own, yeah, which is, oh, you only need one DevOps guy, so meaning I have filing numbers. I'll make sure COVID will never reach my company, right? So we don't want to create that. Instead, we want to enable platform engineers to, like, say you can write TerraForm modules and register them, yeah, so that devs can

Suresh Attaluri  22:24  
consume so what else can platform engineer do?

Swarup Donepudi  22:28  
Platform can create Kubernetes and allow developers to deploy to that Kubernetes. Oh,

Suresh Attaluri  22:34  
is it, yeah. But what is platform engineering doing? If all, if the module is already available. No module is

Swarup Donepudi  22:43  
not already, not already available. Module is available for those people who don't have a platform instead. But our

Suresh Attaluri  22:50  
the first point that we mentioned is platform engineers will write pulumi modules, yeah, and put it on plant and clock, right? That's what is a responsibility of platform engineering in case of a GKE cluster, no, right? No.

Swarup Donepudi  23:04  
So, so GKE cluster requires cloud accounts, right? So say platform engineer wrote a GKE cluster module registered here only for the purposes of other platform engineers to be able to deploy new GK clusters. Let me finish. What is the meaning there is IAC modules are much broader. They are not just for deploying GK clusters. GK clusters within IAC modules have a special meaning. Those are complicated pieces of infrastructure that are not deployed by devs in general. Even though GK classes can be created from the console, they are still making it like self service for other platform engineers to deploy them. But the IAC modules registration is for like we want to enable you to deploy microservices. We want you to enable you to deploy fargate services. We want you to deploy Redis to Kubernetes, right? So we will create all those modules. So

Suresh Attaluri  24:09  
by saying, platform engineers add these pulumi modules for those resources which,

Swarup Donepudi  24:18  
and in fact, they can, in general, the platform units can create environments and share, share allow the devs to start deploying to those environments.

Speaker 1  24:27  
So what do we call this thing?

Swarup Donepudi  24:31  
I'm saying about these things loud so that I can have chatgpt determine those words. So we want to call out those things that way chatgpt goes. That's the whole point. We fail. We suck at coming up with the exact terms,

Suresh Attaluri  24:47  
or for lack of vocabulary or lack of name for that, it is platform engineers deploying complex infrastructure. Setting

Swarup Donepudi  24:57  
up environments. Is the word setting up and yeah, so it's not the complexity is not the determine, but platform engineers are the ones who will kind of set things up for developers to start deploying, like Kafka is a complex, yeah? That that that hasn't fall under this category, right? Yeah. So environments is the word where, when, when you take an organization, the environments have the boundary. Can we

Suresh Attaluri  25:26  
say that, where services can be deployed? Yeah, so environments

Swarup Donepudi  25:34  
control. Like cost associated with environment like credentials are associated with environments.

Suresh Attaluri  25:44  
The other softwares can be run or environment.

Swarup Donepudi  25:48  
We don't have to define it. That's a general for example, our

Suresh Attaluri  25:52  
environment, I don't want

Swarup Donepudi  25:55  
even our environment, is not an abstracted term, is what I'm saying. We tried to align the perceived like definition of environment is what is also considered as an environment in our system. We didn't like create an abstraction like, for example, we can take references of our own companies, right? I came from Zillow, okay. What is an environment is a logical grouping of services. Yes, same thing here again, we didn't create anything. And every environment for it will have a corresponding infrastructure space where the services that are claimed to be deployed into that will land. These are all actually certain set up where DevOps or platform engineers only. So setting up environments has been a very classic problem, and devs don't get involved there. Devs will request for environments so that they can start deploying. So there was a second, yeah, using plant and using plant, yeah, so they can write IAC modules, register them here, or create IAC and register for devs to consume and set up environments. So in our case, what is setting up environments is say they create transverse prod, and say

Suresh Attaluri  27:17  
transverse prod is the environment,

Swarup Donepudi  27:20  
name of the environment, and they configure the Kubernetes credentials so that all services, when developers choose they go and land on a particular Kubernetes cluster, or they'll configure an AWS connection so that any AWS resources that get deployed to that environment will land in a particular AWS account. Yes, and what else can platform engineers do in our case?

Speaker 1  27:48  
Yeah, but they can, that's fine. What

Swarup Donepudi  27:52  
depths can do? They can bootstrap using platform,

Suresh Attaluri  27:56  
okay, but bootstrap would require templates. Templates.

Swarup Donepudi  27:59  
Templates are either readily available or senior engineers can register templates. Yeah, so that is

Suresh Attaluri  28:06  
that also falls in a devs, dev team of devs. So yeah, they will create, and

Swarup Donepudi  28:13  
if at all we want to highlight who creates those templates and want to highlight that, then we create a separate group called the architects of senior engineers. Senior engineers register service templates with all the best practices built in, and devs will create those new services using those templates.

Suresh Attaluri  28:35  
So bootstrap doesn't involve creating actions,

Swarup Donepudi  28:43  
right second of CAC or confidence services and planting road can help. Yeah, those are two different and platform engineers are the one who will create those actions and register. Yeah, these

Suresh Attaluri  28:57  
guys will,

Swarup Donepudi  29:00  
the more I've been thinking about quantum cloud and when we say we are setting the golden standard for internal developer platforms, I started believing that for an internal developer platform to be useful for majority, like a vast number of organizations, customizability should be at the heart with minimal abstractions. Yes. Okay, so IAC modules, zero restrictions enforced. You can accept the APA API is something that we had to create because we need to capture the input from the devs. Hand it off to platform in place. But when it comes to the actual modules itself, you can customize it to your heart's content and register them, and they will be self serviced. And GitHub actions and GitHub workflows, we don't do anything like you can write any kind of GitHub action, register it with the code, source code, template library on plankton cloud, and devs can choose which one which action they want to add to their service. Same thing with service templates for everything we are providing defaults and for everything we are enabling or allowing the organizations to customize these workflows, right? So that is also what we want to depict in here, and we should not get greedy, because this will never come out. If we start getting greedy, this will never come out. We need to settle on something. Okay, this work like, for example, a good start can be as simple as this one. All of what, all of our conversation, is being fed into chatgpt, and it is going, I'm going to have a conversation after this, taking the transcription and requesting for Hey, we want an infographic to show all of the platform's capabilities, but should not be too difficult. And my UX designer is skilled at figma, so can you give him some visual element with very detailed steps like something at the center, engineers at the Left Platform, right senior low level. And these are the connections that each one will give it can it is capable of doing that, and yisha will take that and bring us some kind of prototype we can interact from there. Okay, so, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  31:27  
in case of like columi modules, yeah, managing pulumi modules or TerraForm modules with plant and cloud, if they register, it is easy to search for devs. It will be. But the journey without private cloud would be a GitHub account or some other place where they need to rely on the keyword search.

Swarup Donepudi  31:55  
Or, again, this diagram doesn't have to represent all of that, because we cannot tell the entire story here. We have the opportunity to do those things at several places on the website. Meaning, so you said, I multi cloud, right? IAC workflows that has a pulumi registry deployment component sections, or even the IAC workflows itself. The hero section can have in its own illustration or a video where we can do an iPad explanation also. But

Suresh Attaluri  32:27  
the message we can put here is, with plaid and code, you can rely on one app, but without Plato, you need to go,

Swarup Donepudi  32:35  
okay, so you're saying the without section will have multiple

Suresh Attaluri  32:39  
different tools that you need to interact, interact to get the work done that message we can,

Swarup Donepudi  32:50  
I don't know what's capable, what's possible. We need to wait until all of the synthesis is done, like chatgpt conversations happen, what it is going to give and what can we shall pull off, and then we can see if we can extend that to tell more story or less story. I don't know. I think again, this is a great discussion. We settled on the part of the landing page where we want to illustrate what is an internal developer platform, yes, with and without, with and without,

Suresh Attaluri  33:25  
that is a Yeah, with them. So in this conversation, chatgpt will give us recommendations. That's what Yes,

Suresh Attaluri  33:38  
expectation I.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/01-landing-page/landing-page.p4.features.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:00  
This. Okay, so, continuing the previous discussion, where we talked about, what did we talk about? Yeah, the illustration, illustration for the internal developer platform. So we decided that the hero section is good, and we discussed what changes are needed for this animation, and then followed up with the same GitHub like illustration video, not for different forms, yeah, not directly the illustration video. First, we will have these kind, this kind of categorization. And we talked about what to show in each of the categories. We recorded that as one video, and then we moved on to the next step, the product definition section, and that is this guy. Also

Suresh Attaluri  1:05  
we discussed what should be visual representation,

Swarup Donepudi  1:08  
without and with and platform engineers and developers, etc, so, and we agreed that we will continue discussing just the landing page and finalize what needs to be shown here, and then, what is this section? So this is more sub features for this section. So every page section have some subsections,

Suresh Attaluri  1:35  
so final content will

Swarup Donepudi  1:40  
Yeah, so, final content, landing page, final page. Final landing page, looking at the so each of these is a section. In every section had a title and, okay, yeah, a subtitle and some key points. Okay, so those are what if you have used to generate these sections. So that was the title and description for problem definition, and this is like the

Suresh Attaluri  2:16  
key points subsection for

Swarup Donepudi  2:19  
internal level, the same product. So you get unified operations, you are empowering teams with a driven self service capabilities and simplified workflows, complex DevOps tasks, because due to conversations,

Suresh Attaluri  2:33  
I believe these points will also be given by chatgpt, right? These were earlier. It was given by chatgpt, but considering the discussion that we had in the morning, these points might change.

Swarup Donepudi  2:49  
That is additional work we

Suresh Attaluri  2:52  
keep the same, yeah. So

Swarup Donepudi  2:56  
for now, I believe the bigger hurdle to cross or get over, is the media okay? Like, even still, keeping this without changing this, we can actually launch the website, and then we'll have the full website working, and we'll come back and be like, Oh, this doesn't make sense. Use this space to tell different story. We can iterate for No, yeah. And the fact that right now in this page, no animation is needed, like no media is required, right? This looks good. That's fine. They'll read it and keep going for down. And these are, like, again, this is where the features begin. So going back, so these, this is the feature section, and this maps to the drop down features part. Yeah. We are now going one after the other. So plantora, the AI power DevOps co pilot, revolutionizing DevOps workflow with and then there will be a Learn More button, which will take to the full dedicated page. Okay, okay. And this is the area that we have to for media. So he put some random part, yeah, and we have an opportunity to either create a GIF and also maybe put something like watch video, whatever. So that is what we need to discuss right now, and five guys

Suresh Attaluri  4:24  
and any media, the first easiest form of making content is video or video,

Swarup Donepudi  4:30  
screen recording, screen recording. And for plantora, for us, making a video is very easy because you simply say, we'll start the video. And perfection is not the goal. Any video will do the job. Okay? So we will basically need to finalize the script for what

Suresh Attaluri  4:53  
we want to show so we are sure that it will be a screen recording or a slash video,

Swarup Donepudi  4:58  
yeah, and

Suresh Attaluri  5:01  
what it will be having.

Swarup Donepudi  5:03  
How about so? Or we can also have something like like this, like the chat window with some conversation, which is also a screenshot. Just like this, is a screenshot of quick chat we can have in conversation.

Suresh Attaluri  5:17  
The earlier content or media that we discussed shows how you how

Suresh Attaluri  5:24  
that is, how one can build

Suresh Attaluri  5:26  
through chat, someone can deploy and all those stuff, right? So, recordings are already there. Here we can put some nice chat image, an existing chart. We can take a screenshot, yeah, along with stack jobs or logs, or with or without it? Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  5:45  
And we can also create a simple GIF by like, doing the typing. So we'll have a chat that we want to show, and we'll do the chat and create a GIF out of it and put it here. It's not a video.

Suresh Attaluri  6:00  
How about simply creating a Redis Kuber Redis instance on Kubernetes, the whole journey? Yeah, from, from the point where user asks for or mentioned expresses his intent to create an instance.

Swarup Donepudi  6:15  
So that will be a GIF, and then we'll have a button to say, Watch video. Where? What does watch videos? Watch video is more deeper explanation. Me explaining so. So when, when it is GIF, they may seem though it graphics or whatever, but when we are doing a video, we have more time. If they have clicked on watch video, that means they have, like, we have their attention, so we have the luxury of additional few minutes to explain some stuff around it. Like, yeah, this is a bot. It is capable of doing this because it is for all plant owner, right? The first image will only show that Redis part, but we can also explain what it is capable of. Like, you can invite user. You can do that. You can do things.

Suresh Attaluri  7:07  
So do you think that we need to put the video here or the actual full feature page, which has the whole

Swarup Donepudi  7:13  
so just a link for that is fine here, and maybe on the full feature page in the hero section below the section, will have like a thumb, large thumb, which plays the video itself. So that is another option. Also one of the theme that you will probably come across on the website is repeated content, meaning it's also inspired from GitHub, where GitHub kind of tells the same story over and over again in a different context. Yeah, plan to wrap. And if you go to their enterprise page, it says, plan Torah is a sensory so it meets your enterprise capability. So I saw the team and we implemented that.

Suresh Attaluri  7:54  
So here we have two links. One is, learn more about

Swarup Donepudi  7:58  
discover plantora, plantora and then watch video. Yeah, and watch video will open the same video as the the video that we are going to put on the hero section of the dedicated plant or a page. Or, instead of going there and learning that there is a video, we also put a video small link to directly watch TV.

Suresh Attaluri  8:22  
Yeah, I think that covers election, right? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  8:25  
self service DevOps breaking free from DevOps bottlenecks. So here also the simpler ones are always definitely the video.

Suresh Attaluri  8:36  
I see some overlap between the planter and self service DevOps as a functionality, functionality,

Swarup Donepudi  8:42  
yes,

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
how will you demo a self service DevOps in our product? That is the question.

Swarup Donepudi  8:59  
Yeah, these are two narratives. One is with or without plantara. There is self service. But first part we are saying, we are basically showing off the congregational capabilities, which is obviously a powerful feature. And then we are telling about self service DevOps, okay, explicitly talking about that value proposition. So for me, how do I do that? Is probably again, another video where we don't we are not going to do planta at all. Okay, in this one, we are going to say, hey, here is the deployment store you can browse. You can deploy. Here is a service ministry you can explore. So we are basically giving them a tour of the website, like the console app from a self serving perspective. Okay? Because chat will not give them a chance to see what what is all available, right? It's like a question and answer and chat is not 100% capable of doing everything that is possible, right? So, for example, I want to see this tag job history, or I want to go and, yeah, personally, I don't know.

Suresh Attaluri  10:23  
Basically self service DevOps, something which developer does without platform engineers, right? That is

Swarup Donepudi  10:34  
a yeah, that is the meaning of self service. And

Suresh Attaluri  10:41  
how do we do that is

Swarup Donepudi  10:43  
maybe with and without. We can talk about in the video,

Suresh Attaluri  10:47  
with and without, also we can talk we morning we were discussing about that is

Swarup Donepudi  10:51  
with and without internal developer platform and without the self serving capabilities. What can happen is developer needs to talk to pops engineer, which plant or a developer can self service? That's the narrative that we are showing on IDP as well. I think we can talk about it in the video itself. We're saying, Hey, your platform engineers can create the infrastructure and register them in the programming module, and you can consume it. And that is what we built it you are self serving your requirements. So these

Suresh Attaluri  11:25  
guys, platform engineers, are writing these modules and making it available for

Swarup Donepudi  11:31  
developers to self service, for

Suresh Attaluri  11:35  
them to be self service. So that's what is in our platforms context, self service is providing that framework, yeah, where these platform engineers are able to put something and the other guys were able to consume it? Yes, so I think we can do the information that

Swarup Donepudi  11:52  
we are, yeah, no. Quantum chat, like, then that's a new capability. You don't have to learn user interfaces. You don't have to learn what, where is what? So that is what we emphasize in plant or context. But when it comes to self service, we are emphasizing more on like platform engineer, we are make creating the framework the platform engineers interact with this and like provide the self service options, and developers consume their self service options. Yes, so yeah, the script for here is definitely covering the ability for senior engineers to register cookie cutter templates in the library, or the ability for DevOps engineers to register their actions and workflows in the same library, and ability for platform engineers to register TerraForm or pulumi modules in the registry, and all of them are consumable for developers, so that they can now no longer have to talk to anyone in the organization to consume that automation that is developed. They can self service their request whenever they want. So this is the story. I think this is good, right? I think since we are recording all of this, this becomes, this comes as a script, and chatgpt will tell me what to do during that recording. And as for the image, I think we'll try and ask IR Shah to say, this is the narrative, the same story.

Suresh Attaluri  13:24  
We can't tell you everything in a jiffy and video form. Videos, I don't think we at hero section. People would like to have a hero section, I don't know, because video is something which someone has to click. And

Swarup Donepudi  13:39  
I mean more the full feature pages,

Suresh Attaluri  13:42  
you know? Videos, I don't know if they are,

Swarup Donepudi  13:48  
yeah, so right content to all videos most likely are going to be like watch video.

Suresh Attaluri  13:55  
We either show a screen recording with autoplay. I think we

Swarup Donepudi  13:57  
established maybe this can become a pattern itself, where this video is the same video that is going to play as the hero section video, yes, the dedicated feature page. I think

Suresh Attaluri  14:08  
that's good. But what do we put on the hero section of this?

Swarup Donepudi  14:11  
I think we I think the scripts for the videos are a good input for insha to decide some kind of animation, illustration. Okay, first, we'll make the video for self service. We'll give the script to Isha and say, Hey, can you do something? Can you create an illustration using any technology or stuff like that? Can you do that? And we'll ask, okay, so, yeah, first step is to definitely, for each of these feature pages, videos are necessary which will be linked to next to these, those videos will also be added as the main element on the dedicated pages. And as for what, what should be the graphic. It can be in case of self service, it's a concept. So you cannot do a screenshot

Suresh Attaluri  15:08  
of the app, yeah, we can also screenshots or something.

Swarup Donepudi  15:10  
Yeah, we'll let yourself decide, because we'll have the video script after that. So I think this is also good,

Suresh Attaluri  15:19  
yeah, yeah. We'll

Swarup Donepudi  15:21  
continue next. okay, this is good conversation.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/01-landing-page/landing-page.p5.features-2.md
Unknown Speaker  0:38  
Okay, so I'll Start

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
Recording. Oh, looks like these two cameras are different.

Unknown Speaker  0:47  
Yeah, right, yes,

Swarup Donepudi  0:57  
what I think you had this field.

Alright? So let's continue the discussion of the landing page sections. So I think we went until we got past the product definition section. We agreed that this is going to have the illustration with before, without and with plan down cloud, with platform engineers, developers and senior engineers creating cookie cutter templates, etc. And we agreed that these text sections will not have any media and and then we moved on to the Features section for plant Ara. We agreed that we'll have one GIF or multiple screenshots showing multiple chats. And and I think we also dive, dive somewhat deep into like, what should that content be? What should those screenshots be like? I think I don't remember we discussing it, but I think we ended up agreeing that we create a loom recording explaining plant aura features or capabilities, and add a link alongside discover to watch video. We'll make sure the video watch video pops up, because that helps the visitors get more understanding. And we also talked about the script for the video itself, where we can begin with deploying genes database on Kubernetes and show the stack job progress and then update it and show the version diff and also, finally, probably destroyed, maybe during the demo. Or we can also do a couple cloud resources to make sure that it's not just for Kubernetes, because there is so many products that are being just Kubernetes, but our capabilities are that we can demonstrate multi cloud. It's easy to create a ngcs bucket. It's easy to create a route 53 zone. These are all like resources that can be created very quickly. So I think the script for this video can be like to demonstrate the wild capabilities. It can begin with inviting a user, saying that we can invite users which has nothing to do with deployments or anything, and then we can move on to talking about deploying. We should begin with deploying something on AWS and then GCP, okay, these are the only two clouds we currently support. So I think we can deploy, I think route 53 zone and a GCS bucket. These two are like lightweight resources, and we can probably, maybe, in fact, instead of Route 53 we can actually deploy a VPC. We'll

Suresh Attaluri  4:26  
do a test, because we haven't discussed about the video script yet. That is what I decided to write down. We decided we'll do that when we discuss about the feature complete feature page, okay, okay. And this one we thought, we thought of having few screenshots of plant and plant

Swarup Donepudi  4:46  
borough, okay, yeah, what should those screenshots be? Or should they? I think same thing in screenshots. I guess so, same story, same story that we tell in the video, I think we don't have to innovate on what screenshots to show. The same chat conversations that are shown in the video can be taken, and maybe what do you call the tech collage of those chats can be created, and you shall can probably innovate on how to place those images and stuff. I think those can also be like small text. It doesn't have to be like a pretty big chat at

Suresh Attaluri  5:31  
a high level. The message that you would like to convey with them, with screenshots is you can reach out to plantora, not to platform engineer, get your work done. Yeah, that's the message I've been trying to

Swarup Donepudi  5:47  
Yeah. So the conversations will be as if they're talking to a platform. Platform engineer, hey, plant or I need a Redis Database for my app, and then yeah, the bot will respond, maybe we can even update plant or to behave like platform engineer, like I'm Hey, I'm here, like I have expertise in I'm an expert platform engineer. Ask me what you want to so I think that is a much better branding. I think so instead of simply saying, hey, yeah, I can help you with that. It can tell itself that, hey, I've done many things in platform engineering, yeah. So yeah, I'm this is certainly something that I can help you with. And then it can, like, start dating.

Suresh Attaluri  6:35  
That's the benefit from plant or right, like you, if someone is using plant or,

Swarup Donepudi  6:41  
yeah, no, I'm saying from a sales or marketing tactic perspective, plantora is a term that we introduced as a name for the bot. Instead of calling it a co pilot, right? We knew that it's a new word that we are introducing at the same time. I think we can leverage that to say plantora. Who is plantora, is an experienced platform engineer, yes, available, 24/7, right? I think, because my part

Suresh Attaluri  7:08  
is, what is plant or doing is it is reducing your support tickets, which actually used to be done by platform

Swarup Donepudi  7:17  
engineer? Yeah, exactly. That's the value. But if I want to tell who what is plant Ara, then I'm I just want to say, okay, platform engineer 24/7 on YouTube, it has on duty 24 which has

Suresh Attaluri  7:31  
same intelligence. Do what platform engineers

Swarup Donepudi  7:34  
can do for that can do for you? Yeah. Plant Ara is platform will be made on duty 24 by seven. I think those are the lines that we need to put on like website, right? I think the planter page itself has like the hero section, right? So instead of saying like, I think the right now plan to IA, the page says something like, transform DevOps with conversational instant. We can say, hey, I'm your platform engineer on duty. 24 duty, yeah, I think that's and then we will do the watch video, or maybe for here, we will not do watch video. We will embed the video right here. Okay, we'll move jump from landing page to this one. So let's go back. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  8:25  
we'll come back to the script of video

Swarup Donepudi  8:27  
when we are discussing the full feature page, full page. Okay, I think self service DevOps also we talked about it, yeah, and we said this one, it's hard to demonstrate with.

Suresh Attaluri  8:40  
Will show the deployment, store and Service Hubs, yeah, where platform engineers can cook some modules, or

Swarup Donepudi  8:51  
those are all difficult to make and you cannot I'll talk about video or image, video, yeah, video. We'll talk about video,

Suresh Attaluri  9:03  
screenshots or the GIFs that we are going to put it here is, is around the deployment, stores and service. That's how I'm looking at Yeah, so that one guy is putting it here, and the other developers can self service using them.

Swarup Donepudi  9:21  
Okay, yeah, so I think the story that we are going to tell you in the DevOps video is around like senior for when it comes to service development. So senior engineers can publish templates. Other engineers can create bootstrap quickly using those templates, and DevOps engineers or CICD engineers can publish GitHub actions and workflows. The engineers can add them when they want to their services from the library and platform. Engineers can publish infrastructure modules for provisioning cloud, infra, deploying open source, and the developers can self service via deployment store and pulumi registry. Yeah, I think that's a good story.

Suresh Attaluri  10:04  
What we're talking we're going to talk about registry, pulumi registry, when we say self service, DevOps,

Speaker 1  10:12  
service hub, also service hub for discovered, discovery and bootstrapping

Swarup Donepudi  10:17  
service hub. So

Speaker 2  10:19  
registry, development, deployment, store, and there

Swarup Donepudi  10:22  
is a source code templates library which shows cookie cutter templates, GitHub actions and workflows all in one place. So that is for service part, and this library right and deployment component, store and programming module existing for like the infrastructure modules, like provisioning part,

Suresh Attaluri  10:44  
yeah. So that part side of the product, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  10:46  
So I know we will demonstrate the same script inside the video itself. So I think the theme that we can establish is whatever we are going to explain in the video itself is what is going to drive what we will put here. Because you tell the same story, giving you a glimpse, and when you jump into the

Suresh Attaluri  11:04  
script has to be discussed in more detail, but, but the theme is theme that we are the part of the product that we are going to show as

Swarup Donepudi  11:17  
this history Like there are three parties involved. Who is getting self service is the developer platform engineers and senior engineers are enabling that self service by

Suresh Attaluri  11:29  
publishing how, how, even without plant and clone, that self service can be done right? Like they can still have GitHub and all those other tools, yeah, but what how plant and clone is enabling it is using columi registries. Yeah, that the frames,

Swarup Donepudi  11:47  
it's hard to again, represent all of that information in that image, so, but now that all of this conversation is being captured. But I get your point. And I think it's valuable if we can, like, right, if we can find people who can help us create a visualization that that conveys the message that without plant on Cloud, enabling self service is is a lot more work. There is no central place where developers and platform engineers come and collaborate. There are multiple tools, and there is a lot of documentation that is that would be required to make that self service happen. So it's it's not, it's substandard. There is so the success rate of adopting that self, like all the Self Service intended work will not be, will not reach its target customers, and the productivity gains will be lost because of because of the fact that all of this self service automation is splintered across very like a wide number of tools plant over is bringing all of that to one place where we are providing module to history, deployment component store for both pulumi and TerraForm modules. It can we are doing a registry, and we are providing source code templates library where they can publish GitHub actions, GitHub workflows, GitLab, that is Jenkins, any reusable CICD or service template bootstrapping is all in one place. So I think, yeah, I think you got that nice point where when we talk about what we build, it's important to clearly articulate why we built those, right? So I think the biggest reason is definitely the fact that today, to enable the same self service, there are multiple tools that developers or self service providers or self service consumers need to jump around, which reduces the overall like value that gets delivered with that self service. And we are particularly solving that problem by creating these centralized repositories, like deployment store pulumi module, sorry, in IAC module Registry, or which contains both TerraForm and pulumi modules that are offered maintained by Platinum cloud or the organizations can bring their own and also source code template libraries, again, containing GitHub workflows or cookie cutter templates or GitHub workflows, again, both maintain there. You'll find a lot of the registered ones maintained by plant upload or the organization can bring their own. So yeah, we are creating or making that consuming and providing self service very easy. So it's not, we are not the creators of self service. It's it's a wrong claim to say that we are the first ones to enable self service. We simplified the self service, and we are making the success, increasing the success rate of the intended goal for those self service initiatives, and making the improving the overall quality of life. People call this as quality of life improvements, because it's hard to measure it right then, yeah. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  15:07  
I would like to highlight that there is very low status Q to adapt to this our platform, because we still have those GitHub report like, yeah, talking about.

Swarup Donepudi  15:21  
So you are referring to my one of the point that I learned in the sales pitch, that the biggest competitor is the status quo

Suresh Attaluri  15:31  
solution. So, so when we talk about pulumi registry, we still the underlying repositories are nothing

Swarup Donepudi  15:40  
but a GitHub repository. So GitHub acts as a plumbing history.

Suresh Attaluri  15:44  
So, what, how, what, how and what planet load is. It is just segregating all that information.

Swarup Donepudi  15:52  
Is creating a central

Unknown Speaker  15:55  
place to

Swarup Donepudi  15:56  
collaborate and yeah, so that, yeah, I think we never discussed this aspect of plant town right now that we are focusing on zooming in on, like self service. I think the first conversation I remember you asking me, what is self service, DevOps? I don't understand it. Almost a year ago, exactly a year ago, yes, and we have come, come very long, where we are clearly articulating what is the self service portion of platforms.

Unknown Speaker  16:29  
Okay? So, yeah, this is all good,

Swarup Donepudi  16:33  
okay, service hub and same thing, yeah, here is the media part.

Suresh Attaluri  16:38  
Oh, now, do you think we still need the service hub here?

Swarup Donepudi  16:43  
I believe so. Service hub is the reason why we are promoting service hub a lot is, again, to convey our commitment towards service development, which is like 80% of the work that devs do every day. So while self service develops as a lot like infrastructure provisioning this, that, but, but service development itself is, is, is what where, like developers and companies, are struggling a lot they, although the difficulties in in provisioning cloud infrastructure or deploying open source are kind of slowing down and creating like overall service development, and they are the ones impacting but people, it's hard for us to put the seller like sell that narrative. We want to say we are this is a place where you can also develop services. We are providing a lot more features around service development itself, like, for example, when I when I say self service DevOps, I don't dive much deeper into creating a dot env file. Okay? So that is the reason so we have a dedicated page to talk about all those features that we are specifically developing for service development itself, yeah, yeah, but as a continuation, probably, yeah, I see your point that,

Suresh Attaluri  18:09  
yeah. But also see your point that you can't just hide service hub is such a big thing. Yeah, exactly. You can't just hide it under service, service and for planned and club customers as well. Service hub maintaining services is the biggest, biggest portion of their pain point. So, yeah, definitely we need to highlight so this is,

Swarup Donepudi  18:31  
it's not like we are, like changing we are providing like, crazy amount of value here. Self Service dogs, yes, service hub is like an essential thing. So that is what we are saying. We are putting it out there that we are also doing the essential part. It's self service DevOps, we are like improving the overall quality of life, because others don't do it. But if you use this, you come to this place to for that overall quality of life improvements. You will also be provided with lots of tooling around service development, by providing you discovery, by giving you secrets management, configuration management for services, all of that local development, rtnv generation, and we are going to add more, like observability is only mostly for applies to this guy. So with the CICD side

Unknown Speaker  19:24  
of it also, yeah, exactly, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  19:25  
So what do you think the media should be for media? Oh, this

Swarup Donepudi  19:31  
one, this one. This one begins with the bootstrapping a new micro service from a template that is where. So when we showed self service DevOps, we won't dive into how to create template, how to publish the template, etc. We'll simply include that small portion in the self service DevOps narrative, because from it, from the lens of self serviceness, like engineers can publish, developers can consume. We won't zoom into what those templates are, how the those are consumed, etc. But here we can directly open service, click on Bootstrap and choose one of the templates, and then add cacd to that, and then deploy it as a micro service, or a fargate service, or a ECS service or a lambda service. Show that and how it relates to stack jobs. So relating it to stack jobs is not the important part. We just have to demonstrate that this platform is capable of helping developers, onboarding developers fairly quickly by helping them discover all the registry of services, of previously created services. And it can also help them understand quickly like create a new service and then get going quickly. So bootstrapping to production or lower environments is much quicker. Again, we are not claiming that we are the ones who put it first, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  20:55  
So at a high level, we'll go through the journey of bootstrapping, building and deploying, yeah, or operate as well, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  21:04  
if it is a Kubernetes service for now, operating will add more via actions, as we talked in our previous sessions here, but yeah, for now, show the operations part for Kubernetes services only

Suresh Attaluri  21:18  
at a high level. Let's assume that we have, we'll have multiple screenshots put out here. Yeah, all these elements of building bootstrapping, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  21:27  
maybe, maybe even other things, even a journey animation will also not animation, a simple like Journey diagram, like bootstraps are nice.

Suresh Attaluri  21:37  
Also, I don't know if it will be at the top. Also, we decided we'll show how the build part, bootstrap part and provisioning, like yesterday we have written those categories, so yeah, but okay,

Swarup Donepudi  21:53  
we'll see. We'll see. Yeah, I think again, repetition is okay, no,

Suresh Attaluri  21:58  
but that will be more of a GIF and more media content, which is, that's how we are imagined or we discussed. This

Swarup Donepudi  22:08  
is more lengthy version explaining for taking more like five minutes of time creating a video up there. It's not going to be videos.

Speaker 2  22:17  
It's going to be a couple screenshots with GIFs. Here it will be screenshots.

Swarup Donepudi  22:21  
Yeah, it will be screenshot. Or, I'm saying because this is service hub, we can also show like Bootstrap, setup, CICD, deploy, operate, and we can probably say, discover, service hub, build GitHub, actions and workflows. We will do some type of diagram or screenshots. I think the easier work is definitely screenshot. So we'll shoot for that, like, take semi sub screenshot.

Suresh Attaluri  22:46  
Yeah, one thing that I'm realizing is, if we figure out the video part, then we will get, yeah, I think to know what should be put on the landing page section. Yes,

Swarup Donepudi  22:57  
I think we will do the videos, videos first, and then we will do work on these, like whatever images we want here, because videos will now, the videos will definitely carve out the scope for the story that we are telling, and obviously that is the story that we want to visually represent here. So I think once we have the video nailed down, I think we can then talk about what should be the image format, yes,

Suresh Attaluri  23:25  
okay, integrate, but yeah, but at a high level, we know what has to be represented as this feature service of Yeah, yes. Next is integrated IAC workflows, deployment simplified.

Swarup Donepudi  23:44  
So this is built in infrastructure as code, is what we want to say, just like we said self service DevOps from a self service perspective, like everything. And then we talked about the importance of the 80% of work that people do, which is like creating services, deploying them, etc, and then we say, Okay, now you got most of to do, which is, you have open source deployments, you have cloud infrastructure, your managed services. And for all that, you need infrastructure as code. And we have simplified that which is integrated, Ise workflows.

Speaker 2  24:21  
So what, which part of the product are we going

Swarup Donepudi  24:26  
to so this is all about. So here we just like the way I said, in service of, I will begin my journey with showing service of, service of Bootstrap, bootstrap cell phone, of the cookie cutter templates create the repository, add GitHub action, and then deploy by adding it customized micro service, and then operate by so that completes the slide. This when, when we talk about integrated IAC workflows, we are going to explain that we begin our journey with the deployment store. Okay, okay, these are all the things for which ISC modules have been already created, and you can either choose to run pulumi or TerraForm. Let's say we let's imagine that TerraForm is already ready by then, and then, if it is not ready, we say pulumi is already there. TerraForm integration is coming soon, and what you can do is you can click on that, and here are all the attributes, and when you click on it, instantly, pulumi preview apply is created, and the stack jobs history is there, and every change is captured as version history. All the configuration changes. And here is the pulumi module registry. And if you want customizations, you can create your own pulumi module registers here, and we will show stack job settings where you can configure either at organization level. We'll talk about how to configure pulumi back and and, yeah, all of that. So basically, so there is a lot to tell here, and the scope is, how do you do IAC with random code? And we maybe you can also apply the same philosophy of with and without, like, how would you achieve the same thing without? Maybe we can talk briefly about that, or do a whiteboard in the same recording, explaining, if, let's imagine a life where you don't have anything like plant and cloud, then your developers would sorry, platform engineers would publish these on GitHub and document it on, say, Confluence and and your developers will search on Confluence as if there is a module, etc. If there is, then how do you they consume it is, they create a repository, and they set up their own cacd. And all of those steps are now condensed into much simpler self service developer experience, where they can explore what is available in the store and and they can. They don't have to do any customer like CICD setup. They can. We are not abstracting anything. They can still do that. We have created GitHub actions to create film like CICD for these also like, you can put your configuration in a git repository and add a GitHub action so that whenever you make the configuration change, if you like that workflow, Git workflow, you make a configuration change commit, but you'll have to add, like, the CICD for it, or there is one available in the this template, so on, so forth. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  27:28  
So by integrated ISC workflows, you're saying that you give us some config and that will automatically trigger a workflow, yeah. So that workflow is nothing, but we deploy something for

Swarup Donepudi  27:41  
us is the preview apply the

Suresh Attaluri  27:45  
steps of stack job. Stack job will be started. So, yeah, same thing in GitHub. You need to modify the configs, which is now changed to a form.

Swarup Donepudi  27:56  
Again, that's what we so this is a an alternative, but they can still achieve the same thing via GitHub also, yeah, like they can put the Redis configuration in a GitHub repository. They make the change from saying 3.5 G to 4.4 G as the disk size, and they get commit, push, and action gets triggered that does not apply with hyphen T for following the stack job progress. And this is the stack job progressing. So we are not taking away that ability if you if that is what you are into, we still like provide value, because whatever is being deployed from any git repository surfaces as history here, so auditing and all those capabilities are still valuable.

Suresh Attaluri  28:41  
So the only change is if, without plant and cloud, they need to figure out the module TerraForm or coronavi module that they have to apply to this configuration that they are providing, or they have to figure out what is

Swarup Donepudi  29:01  
and then the generality part is the visibility or transparency, like, which modules have been created by whom, where are they published? What is the like washing and how do you consume that? What are the steps involved in consuming side things and what, what infrastructure got created and who created them? So these are difficult questions to find answers for in growing companies, in general and larger companies, it becomes even difficult. So we are solving the problem of creating the automation and share publishing the automation in the first place, right? And then we are also solving, somewhat improving the overall quality of life for developers to discover that automation and consume that automation, right? So that is, and Kubernetes dashboard. This is for, again, mostly highlighting what that we did, but as a feature set, I think, yeah, actually, this falls under the operation part, yeah, yeah. So it's not only for services, right? So you deploy a Redis, or you deploy Mongo, it's in those are not maybe we thought we'll put the also, those also in services up. But for now, you can, if it's fair to say, you deploy anything on the Kubernetes Oh, well, you can. So there is actually a lot more to Kubernetes than just services. Like, for example, you deploy GKs cluster, you can have access to the entire GK cluster dashboard. Again, this is not, we didn't invent this, but this is more around application oriented Kubernetes visualizations, so meaning, you deploy your services, you deploy MongoDB, whatever, right? You are only going to see the resources that are created for it, etc, etc. So while Kubernetes dashboard, it's difficult for developers to navigate and find what they want. Now we have integrated Kubernetes, simplified Kubernetes dashboard around the deployed services. Okay, while we are also providing cluster level resources, like all namespaces, all resources is more for cluster administrators and administration, but this is more for more valuable for like individual developers who deploy services, they get immediate, instant access to that. So we want to highlight it. We don't want to hide it again under the service. That's the intention here. And again, we will decide the image that we are going to put after we create the video. And video is pretty straightforward there. We can simply show what is available, like the all the features. Like you can edit you can look up all the Kubernetes resources created for your service. You can edit them. You can stream logs for your pods. You can exec into the containers. So these are like the first straightforward, straightforward value, value giving feature. So we'll demonstrate those, and we'll do the same screenshots here. I think that's good. Okay, I think it's 31 minutes. Will this is the last one. I guess our last two. Will continue them later. Okay, do you have any concluding notes here? Or are you good? I


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f1-plantora-1.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:04  
All right, so again, the focus is to continue the discussions, and because we have already finished the landing page, now we are jumping on to the feature pages, and here we are going to first begin with plant aura AI, the world's first DevOps co pilot, and this is what we are trying to advertise it as. So I will navigate to that page on figma, and here it is, and I recall as considering a replacement for the current hero section title, which says transforms, transform DevOps with conversational AI. And we thought a better replacement could be platform engineer on duty 24/7 so Suresh, what do you think?

Speaker 1  1:07  
Yeah, transform DevOps with conversational. AI versus platform, engineer on

Swarup Donepudi  1:15  
duty, 24/7 on engineering, 24/7 platform,

Suresh Attaluri  1:18  
I don't know if that. I'm not sure which one should be it. But the other aspects platform engineering, 24/7, we want, we want to highlight that there is an assistant, a DevOps assistant for you, for your developer, that can answer certain things without manual intervention. That's the point, right?

Swarup Donepudi  1:45  
Yeah, but this is a sales website. So sales websites require catchy terms. Which one? Yeah, we will let chargeability determine. And one of the concerns you we both talked about to do that is we might probably like make it, make it ourselves. Difficult to sell platinum cloud to DevOps or platform engineering teams if we say that we have built their own alternative. But that's not the idea. So you need to be careful there. So if we put the section title as platform engineer on call 24/7 that can be better saying instead of saying on duty 24/7 we can say on call. 2747 on call is essentially like if you have a platform team, yeah, you usually have one guy, one of them as on call or helping the devs whenever they need. So we can say this plant or as platform engineer on call 20%

Suresh Attaluri  2:47  
so I think as a different you can still have the transform DevOps with conversational AI, okay, but

Swarup Donepudi  2:55  
the reason why I considered an alternative is this is very close to what we have on the main landing page as well. Conversational DevOps is the feature. So there is so much conversational, conversational that's very like, yeah, maybe something different.

Suresh Attaluri  3:11  
Okay, in that case, let's figure out the what do we call the Heading, Heading? But let's not mix the support part of it or the on call, on call benefit that user is going to get. Let's mention that as a subcategory or benefits that they are going to get from this feature. Let's look at the on call thing as a benefit. That on

Swarup Donepudi  3:40  
call is actually probably a bad term too, because when people say on call, that means they may assume that, oh, if something goes wrong in production for the application, then this guy is going to be there and fixing that stuff. So that might send a wrong message on to this on call is probably a bad on duty may also be a bad so, yeah, so maybe we can also simply say the world's first DevOps co pilot, as simple as that, right? I think that is better. That kind of tells what it is, and it doesn't lead any misconceptions like this is going to take care of any production outages automatically or anything. It's a DevOps co pilot.

Suresh Attaluri  4:22  
Can we see how GitHub is positioning their co pilot? I mean, how is there? Just for a reference,

Swarup Donepudi  4:29  
yeah, so github.com co pilot, so it says world's most widely adopted a developer

Suresh Attaluri  4:39  
two, a developer two, oh, yeah. Which is still up. The same sentence is still applicable for except

Swarup Donepudi  4:46  
most widely adopted. We'll say the words first. That's what I'm thinking. We are saying, right? DevOps co pilot, we can also add for developers, if needed. I. Um, or we can simply stick with the world's first DevOps co pilot. I think because it's also leading to from, from this, it says introducing plant, or the world's first DevOps co pilot, they come here plant, or maybe it should simply say the world's first DevOps co pilot. I think that's fine. We'll stick with that. I'll move on. Okay, and

Suresh Attaluri  5:23  
do we have this pattern? I see there are two things here on this section, like plant or AI. We are calling the feature. We are giving a name to that feature as plant or AI, and we are giving a single one punch line, one catch slime or one, I don't know. So that

Swarup Donepudi  5:40  
is what we are doing here. Okay, so everything

Suresh Attaluri  5:43  
has a name, and this is also

Swarup Donepudi  5:47  
inspired from our source, which is GitHub. Okay, everything has a title and but this is not again here, so the punch line will not be here, but, yeah, we do have those punch lines everywhere, and they have titles. But the hero section we have, yeah, this is only for menu part, yeah. So, so, going back to the plantora page, the section, Hero section title will be modified to say the world's first DevOps co pilot will keep the subsection as is and or maybe we can update this to probably say something more meaningful, which is the this is called, I think subs hero section tagline or something. So right now it says, meet plant aura, your AI power DevOps co pilot for simplified, efficient and infrastructure intuitive infrastructure management, we can probably come up with something more meaningful there.

Suresh Attaluri  6:53  
Also, I think we had a short discussion earlier. How about branding this plant, or as, I don't know how, as plant and co pilot, or like, how GitHub is doing, or co pilot GitHub, or co pilot, plant and co pilot, plant and co pilot, just,

Swarup Donepudi  7:17  
yeah, simple thought, Yeah, we didn't build so much material around plantora in the app, in on the website. So at this point, I'm just like slightly hesitating because it might push out. And also, I'm not finding that as a huge improvement over plant or itself. I

Suresh Attaluri  7:44  
think even planter sounds well, the only thing that we discussed is plant. Or by saying plant or we need to explain it to people that it's a co pilot. Yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  7:57  
anybody who comes here, right, nobody is going to learn about plantora Outside Plant and cloud, okay, until, unless they are on the sales website, they won't see plant or for sure, because we are nobody in the market, right, okay? And we are putting so much around plantora to clearly communicate that it is a COVID, okay, so it people don't have to understand that feature by its name, we are putting sufficient sales material around it to make it very easy for people to understand that. In fact, we did. We overdid it to a point where we see a lot of places where it says plant, Oracle, pilot, plant or a plant or co pilot. That's not a risk. So as for the tagline itself, it says, meet plan Dora, your AI port, DevOps co pilot for simplified, efficient and so instead of this, can we put a liner that helps any visitor clearly understand what it is, what is the problem that it is set to solve, right? Like, for example, when, when I'm using plantora, or this chat chat bot on a day to day basis, which I am, for example, I was trying to create a necessary bucket and a DynamoDB table to set up TerraForm state backend for for test purposes. And in the past, I used to begin by thinking or Googling, hey, how do I do that? Blah, blah, blah. Instead, I simply asked in the chat conversation I am creating because I want to use it for this thing and plant or the chat or the bot, requested me to provide a name, and I think the environment the plant term cloud environment. So I gave it both, and it used that context to construct the version message saying creating an x3 bucket to be used as TerraForm state backend and the plumie stack. Back ran and the s3 bucket got created in AWS account, and I followed it up with creating the DynamoDB table. So this is the first time I experienced something that I've never seen before. I don't know if there are other places where I get the same experience, but with simple chat conversation, I was able to create both history bucket and a DynamoDB table, and I was able to instantly use those as my TerraForm straight backend, and it all worked, right? So the point I'm trying to make is, as a developer, or even an ops engineer, I have experienced for the first time, being able to provision cloud infrastructure with cons, with simple conversation, where I was asked some information that I can provide, and the rest was, was figured out by plan Dora, and it made the necessary API calls to plant on cloud. So I didn't really have to learn about anything about plant and cloud in this process, except for, oh, I need an environment to do the whole thing, right? So how can we represent that simplicity in in and utilize this space to provide a more clear, meaningful stuff? Okay,

Speaker 1  11:18  
I don't know the purpose of the line. I mean, I don't have any.

Swarup Donepudi  11:23  
You can wear the hat of the visitor of the website and see, oh, you visited the website just now, and you see the world's first DevOps co pilot, yeah, what would, can you like imagine what could have been a better line here that? So I'm

Suresh Attaluri  11:41  
thinking, I would, I would expect leading the reading that third line like a feature name, a short description, and then this again, a description about the feature, the third level of second level of discrete describing that feature. I would like to know what does, what does it does, or how can I use it, right, like when at a high level and and whatever you told about how you used it, I see plantora providing this guided experience, okay, at a single spot, a single place, which is a charge to create a provisional infrastructure, right?

Swarup Donepudi  12:31  
So maybe, maybe just thinking about it right now, even like going back to my own experience of using plant and cloud, I think I actually probably want, or wanted to emphasize on the fact that I didn't need to learn plant on Cloud to use plant on Cloud to do that stuff, just because there is plan like plant aura, right? If this is not the case, what would have been my alternate method is either open like do Command K, navigate to quick actions, say, deploy s3 bucket, or create s3 bucket and look at the form. Use this in text, information, right? And then go to DynamoDB, create form, fill out that information versus this

Suresh Attaluri  13:22  
plan, plan to raise removing that necessity of understanding. Plant and cloud platform, also the providers platform, like, what are the inputs that a user need to give to create an s3 bucket? So the provider platform, that's some learning that users need to do at the provider end and also at the plant and cloud end, right? But here we are saying you will get a guided experience. To me, something random biggest

Swarup Donepudi  13:57  
benefit, right? That's meaning eliminating the need for the users to learn plant on Cloud, to use plant on Cloud is what plant aura enables first, and also like, yeah, plant down cloud, in a way, already abstracts away the cloud providers. Plant download itself, even without the chat ops part, yeah, we are kind of not requesting the user to learn about any configuration that is needed by the cloud provider. We are already like documenting it via help text and field names and all that. However, in order to use leverage that abstraction, the users first need to understand how to use plankton flow, yeah, meaning they need to learn that, hey, in order to create any deployment, you need to use quick actions or do some search to get to the form. Fill out the form, click Submit, and then you will be shown the stack, job progress and stuff, whereas, without navigating the interface of client conclude itself. I just use chat, I provision two resources. So I So again, I'm feeling I'm explicitly calling out all of this information for chat, chat GPT to understand and synthesize all of this information. To give us those two liner punch line for the hero section, which contains the title of DevOp, or the world's first DevOps co pilot, and we both talked about the most important value that it provides users is the obviating the need to learn new interfaces or new systems and just get their stuff done with without that learning curve.

Suresh Attaluri  15:39  
And with our conversation, the theme of this section is, how is how is it helping users? I believe that's what the theme for this section

Swarup Donepudi  15:55  
would be, right? You mean the hero section, that

Suresh Attaluri  15:59  
the tagline thing we are talking about, yeah, the Hero Session has a name. Then what what we call these three sections? Man,

Swarup Donepudi  16:16  
Hero section is this section every web page now what we call this will be the hero section title, this one that is a feature name. Yeah. Ignore this. Ignore this. We are on already on the feature page. We are never talking about this. This is just a way for users to know where they are on the website. Yes, legal address and Okay, so you won't use this highlighter. I Okay,

so you have long press, hold and then start moving.

Suresh Attaluri  16:54  
Okay, so this one is title, title of the feature, and this one, we are calling it as tagline, tagline.

Swarup Donepudi  17:02  
We can also simply call it subtitling. That's more easier, I guess,

Suresh Attaluri  17:06  
title and subtitle, yeah. So the theme of hero section, theme of title would be explaining what it's

Swarup Donepudi  17:17  
more of inclined towards sales friendly, meaning something fancier, yeah, fancier. But also kind of conveys what it is. So it's like there is a subtle difference there, yeah, but it is. It's important to be sales friendly, more elevated title to create some excitement, etc, yeah. And

Suresh Attaluri  17:38  
theme of subtitle is, what is the value that this feature is will give to users? Yeah, more or less a small description, yeah. And in case of plant Dora now,

Swarup Donepudi  17:50  
yeah. And also it's it's not necessary that whatever we have currently is also created by chat repeat itself on all the conversation, so we don't have to replace it. Just for the sake of replacing it, we are just having this conversation to see if that we can do anything better, or if whatever we already have can can be a good subtitle already. So yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  18:16  
so the current subtitle is your AI powered for simplified, efficient and intuitive infrastructure management. In case of intuitive, the only word that I can think of is a guided Yeah, I'm open for chat, GPT to put more this thing. Okay, I don't know how, but yeah, that's all it

Swarup Donepudi  18:41  
is, yeah, so I think it can use some improvement. So yeah, we'll now let's move on to the watch video section, right? So we said we wanted to a we can either put the video right below, or we can leave it to watch video section. Or we can have the video here instead, instead of this, this thing, animation or illustration, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  19:12  
I'm brought to having video at the top that the hero section, only some part of it being

Swarup Donepudi  19:17  
shown. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:20  
I don't know, what do you think? Let's

Swarup Donepudi  19:23  
always refer to what we've always done. So yeah, I think even here, it's the same thing hero section, and a hint that if you scroll down, there is more, there is you can watch. So you're in our section, we will ask if shot to do the same thing, which is the hero section should be shown, and let the users know that there is a section right below which they can get to by scrolling up. And that should be the we. View itself. So now going back to the plantora page. Yeah, maybe some of this can be adjusted to make it probably slightly useless space here, and move this guy maybe to the right or somewhere. I don't know. I will. We should not be the ones designing it. We let us share know that the users should get a hint that they can scroll up to get more content. Yes, all right, so now, okay, that's great, but what should be the content of the video itself

Speaker 1  20:43  
is the script is what we're talking about. We don't

Swarup Donepudi  20:48  
have to think of script as a script, because that kind of might throw us away. You just have to, like, what's the purpose of this video in the first place is we want to use two to three minutes to show the best part of plant Ara or this feature. Yeah, right. And maybe you can begin what? What, according to you, is some you don't have to think about script. You just script. You just have to tell me if you were demonstrating plan Torah to a potential future customer or any, anyone who you think can benefit from it, what would be your choice of actions that you would do on plantora or on the platform entirely to demonstrate those capabilities. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  21:53  
like what we discussed, you know, yeah, the same will go through the developers journey. Only need a developer trying to build a Java back end service, and I want, or there is an existing back end service, Java back end service we

Swarup Donepudi  22:22  
can begin with. Begin with bootstrapping. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  22:24  
I mean, the our whole platform has this Bootstrap,

Swarup Donepudi  22:28  
the train right through Bootstrap, Bootstrap

Suresh Attaluri  22:32  
and all those things. But the reason I'm not mentioning those because the right now they are not in November state. So let's first. Figure out the provision part, the journey of provision part. And then, if we can calculate that, then we'll go.

Swarup Donepudi  22:49  
Once we have the bootstrapping and cacd part ready, service of functionality building, we will update the video. Update

Suresh Attaluri  22:57  
The video will start from this thing apart. But let's say, meet a developer in an organization. I have access to plant and cloud, and I already have a service running now I want to deploy now. I want a new infrastructure called Redis. I want to set up a Redis instance for my service to implement a new feature, implement a feature in our product. So the first thing that I'll I'll be doing is I'll come to, I don't know if we have to establish the problem, but how it is.

Swarup Donepudi  23:47  
Or, I think important part here is we can make a few assumptions. And let's imagine we are watching a lot of videos on YouTube too, right? Every time somebody shows us something, they don't begin from the actual origins, right? Okay, they kind of get to the beat of it right away. Like, for example, we have been watching land chain videos, right? They don't say, hey, here is how you set a plan, chain framework, SDK, blah, blah, blah, okay. They just get to the point, which is, okay.

Suresh Attaluri  24:16  
My point is, do we need to establish the problem and then show them the before and after. Should the videos? Theme will look like that? Or we can just jump in?

Swarup Donepudi  24:28  
Yeah, I think again, most people do understand. So again, the theme, the part of the what is that we are trying to convey here on this particular page is the conversational capabilities, not like the whole problem. And when you have services, you would need database. So when you need database, you can come here. All of that is not necessary, okay, we can that can be as simple as saying, Hey, I'm pretty sure most of the services. Is need some kind of databases, or some other open source software or some cloud infrastructure. So as a developer, how this is how you can leverage the DevOps co pilot, and you can start it, you can jump right into it, instead of like setting up the setting that's all waste of time and not a lot of value on this particular page. Video, okay, so the script begins with saying, let's imagine your service requires a Redis Database, as simple as that, yeah, and you're using Google. It is and so

Suresh Attaluri  25:33  
I don't see any we can directly jump into the product and show the product. Yeah? Saying this is our plant or interface. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  25:41  
you don't even have to mention those words, yeah. So the key I learned is don't waste your time and script vocabulary with saying mention obvious things. Okay, when you are already there, people know that that is your plan. Dora interface, right? Okay, so key aspect of sales content is get to the most important part as soon as possible. If that seems interesting, people will figure out the rest, meaning they will invest their energy to actually learn about how to sign up, how to navigate. So we will use, just like an quick introduction to say, if you need any cloud infrastructure or open source, here is how you can do it first. Let's imagine your service needs a Redis Database without having spending any money. You can do it on Kubernetes. So let me show you how to do that right. And you can notice that user actions the intent in a chart, and you can see that the guided conversation is requesting you to provide this information, and I am providing this information, and as soon as I did, the bot responds with the may deploy. It's deployed. And,

Speaker 1  27:01  
yeah, we don't know. We need to highlight that.

Swarup Donepudi  27:04  
We want to highlight we want to highlight that. And we also want to also show that. Notice that, as well as the stack job is created, and you created this from this thing on second half of the screen, you should refresh the dashboard and show that. Notice that as new stack job is running, you created it. And here is the resource detail of the etc, etc. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  27:26  
we jump from Stack chat to the stack job. We will

Swarup Donepudi  27:29  
have both. We'll have two half screens, okay, where one is the plant over chat, and the second half is the dashboard itself, where we are showing the chat at the same time we are showing that also,

Suresh Attaluri  27:45  
yeah, we can eliminate that. And how about we? I mean, another way of demoing it. How about instead of choosing a Kubernetes resource, we choose AWS Exactly.

Swarup Donepudi  27:55  
Instead of wasting time there, we want to show that it's a multi cloud any it's very easy for people to automate Kubernetes. Kubernetes has, like lots of tooling around it. Help. Chats are very easy way. So people might brush your technology stack off simply assuming that we are running a health chart behind the scenes. So we want to demonstrate multi cloud aspect of current on cloud by saying, let's imagine now you need a storage bucket.

Suresh Attaluri  28:27  
Storage Bucket, yeah, and we provide that intent on the chart, yeah. So our radio starts. In

Swarup Donepudi  28:33  
fact, instead of s3 bucket, we can also do a DynamoDB, because that is also quick, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  28:38  
and yeah. And we show this nice comparison, that here the stack job is has started, and here the resources are, yeah, and we can do the same thing for the GCP also, yeah. I believe Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  28:53  
It's not Yeah. We can simply say it's not very common to see organizations using multiple clouds, but it's there for you if you need it. So let's, let's say I now want to deploy, create a new GC storage bucket on Google Cloud, instead of s3 bucket. So I say I need an GCS bucket, it, transfer it, and we open Google Cloud, and there is that. And then maybe, as a conclusion, at the end, at the very end, we can say, so all of what we have done in the chat is now there 14 to like see, will go to Canvas, will show the resources have not created. And we

Speaker 1  29:38  
will then, I don't know if we have to move from the chart,

Swarup Donepudi  29:42  
yeah, we

Unknown Speaker  29:46  
will have

Swarup Donepudi  29:48  
other automation. Is where that needs to be emphasized, right? So I think, yeah, we should not show everything in every video. Yeah, let's keep it. Short, keep it short and demonstrate the capabilities of conversational power, guided resource creation, embedded stack jobs,

Suresh Attaluri  30:10  
ability to request something and ability to see the effect. So that's what we need to convey in this video. And

Swarup Donepudi  30:19  
then when it comes to I was also tempted to say that this automation that you are seeing is actually a open source and all that, but I think that should be saved for integrated IISC workflows part. Maybe there also we will begin with saying I want to deploy this. But where is this IISC coming from? That is where, that is the page where we should talk about it, which is project plan, done open source. Here is the plumie module code. This is where it is running. All these are available

Unknown Speaker  30:49  
as a framework. We need to, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  30:51  
that IAC workflows page is not on plant or page, plant or a page. We need to make sure we are disciplined enough to only we

Suresh Attaluri  31:00  
along with AWS and GCP, we also demonstrate the Kubernetes part as a third one, like we can still do that. I

Swarup Donepudi  31:09  
thought the first one itself is Kubernetes. You want to begin with AWS

Suresh Attaluri  31:13  
that is more, that is more AWS

Swarup Donepudi  31:15  
or GCP, that those three three, because we will edit the video. Also, we will cut down here with the name the bot takes

Unknown Speaker  31:24  
the stack, job, exhibition time. We can

Swarup Donepudi  31:28  
cut every we will only include the step. Response will be quick. We'll say we are like, moving. We won't even say, like, that's what that is. Where we need to be we need to avoid temptations that we will need to educate user about everything that is happening, that we are editing and we are cutting down time. All of that is not necessary. People are smart enough to understand what's going on, and we want to utilize those two to three minutes to get their attention, to demonstrate the core capabilities of that feature page. I think right now we have a good, finalized, scoped out script where we begin with I want, let's imagine your service would need a DynamoDB table. So this is how, hey, plant Ara, I need DynamoDB table for my service, and we'll provide the inputs. We get a DynamoDB table. We open AWS console right at both times. Just before we start the conversation, we show the we have the AWS DynamoDB table service page right there. We'll say that I don't have any I want to create. And you say, create. It creates. We refresh. Here is an NGO DB table. And then we can say, hey, I also need a GCS bucket. We'll go to Google Cloud Storage bucket and say, refresh, and there is nothing, and I create something. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  32:52  
as a demo, we only show the positive

Swarup Donepudi  32:54  
flow of it. We are not going to

Suresh Attaluri  32:57  
like, enter the wrong input and then see how it reacts, and also, and then we say, simple, my

Swarup Donepudi  33:03  
service also requires a Redis Cache, so we'll deploy that. And at the end, we'll also say, oh, I want, I want to set the CPU limits for my Redis or memory limits for my Redis Cache, to do it twice, double. So the final part of the screen script is to say, I want to double the Redis memory, yeah, and then it shows the unified div. And

Unknown Speaker  33:31  
now you're talking about another intent, right?

Swarup Donepudi  33:34  
Okay, not intent. It's still the capabilities of planter only,

Suresh Attaluri  33:38  
yeah, planter only. But okay, you apart from creating, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  33:45  
it's not Hello worlds, yeah. So advanced enough to we

Speaker 1  33:48  
try out three multi cloud, multi cloud part. No, we have

Swarup Donepudi  33:54  
the creation part. You can create resources and create multi cloud resources and then

Speaker 1  33:59  
finally update them as well. That's what you want to

Swarup Donepudi  34:03  
and let's see if, if the script gives us sufficient time, and all of this has, I think we squeezed into two to three minutes. Yeah, let's

Suresh Attaluri  34:10  
first try do the Create part. That's for sure. We are going to do it. We'll see how it comes out. Is it too long, too short. Yeah, too much.

Swarup Donepudi  34:25  
As part of the script, we will do all three, which is create, update, okay, yeah, yeah. If we think that we are going beyond the Create part, extending the script for long,

Suresh Attaluri  34:36  
yeah, that's how we can do. We should not jump to a new provider, yeah, if you want to demonstrate update, then that's, I think that's more we keep it along with create like we have created it now we want to modify

Swarup Donepudi  34:47  
it, yeah, and yeah. So that's, that's good, okay, moving beyond. This is the first section says, challenge, navigating complex DevOps landscape. Developers often grapple with, integrate interfaces, endless documentation and stream learning curves just to perform routine DevOps. Each tool comes with this. Been talking about, I think I am happy with this. The challenge, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  35:13  
getting complex DevOps landscape. That's what we discussed when chatgpt came

Swarup Donepudi  35:19  
up with these titles and descriptions. Description based on these historical conversations. And

Suresh Attaluri  35:26  
what is, I think we need to figure out the image here, right?

Swarup Donepudi  35:29  
Isn't it? I think that's okay our or we can use the menus. It is a

Unknown Speaker  35:35  
relevant image. This is from irrelevant.

Swarup Donepudi  35:39  
If we want to do any better, we can show menus and we

Suresh Attaluri  35:44  
can have the same GIF which which we are planning to have it on the home screen, the actual this thing. So with this script, we decided that will, once we are done with the video, we'll come up with a GIF, or

Swarup Donepudi  35:59  
maybe, right? So, yeah, I'm just slightly more a little more hesitant in overburdening ourselves. Well, complicated this thing, like, for example, as soon as you say this, if this is not relevant, we will write, okay, okay. Like, for example, when you see repetitive stuff, right? This one and this one, okay, maybe might make sense here, but there is, this is used in lot of places, so it does not make sense. So that is the areas where we are going to work on to get what is right. For example, this one right kind of appropriate. So we live with that, so that, because we have so much work to do, we go beyond and we like do the entire journey and come back and be like, let's probably make improvements.

Suresh Attaluri  36:44  
What are these points? I mean, I know hero section videos, yeah, and then

Swarup Donepudi  36:52  
sections is what I refer to during my conversations with chat GPT, every page will have hero section. Page sections. But I consistently used that term to say I give me a hero. Is also called Hero element sometimes, and then give me page sections.

Suresh Attaluri  37:14  
Page sections, the theme of page sections, of challenges, I think,

Swarup Donepudi  37:20  
page section so my approach when I was doing this is hrgpt. I'm going to tell you all about this. Okay, give me hirovite. Give me six page sections. Six page okay, with the title for each of the page section and some description or subtitle for that section.

Unknown Speaker  37:42  
Okay, the same thing what we did for the I told you

Swarup Donepudi  37:45  
that it has to all of those sections combined, starting from Hero element to the end of the page. Sure, tell a cohesive story and cover all the aspects of what, whatever I already explained, right? So these, I didn't tell it that the first one should be a challenge. So it came up with so

Suresh Attaluri  38:06  
it is trying to establish the problem. Yeah, we talked about feature. Now it is trying to create, have a structure that what is the problem?

Swarup Donepudi  38:13  
This is not by me. It's all I only kind of reviewed what it gave at the end and whenever I was, like, satisfied and like, moved on, perfect. And the

Suresh Attaluri  38:26  
other one is the solution, I believe, yeah, the first part is challenge, and this part is the solution. Like plan, we say that plantar is the solution to handle that complexity, and then guided resource.

Swarup Donepudi  38:42  
So here easy. So this one says, right, I think this is good. We move on. This one is not because it says guided resource creation made easy. We will add a GIF. Here. We say, I want to deploy something, and it prompts for you, we give input, and

Suresh Attaluri  39:03  
to show how it is guided, you need to show the problem. Recently,

Swarup Donepudi  39:08  
I did Dynamo degree, and I think that's a great example, where it said, Give me name environment. And that's like slightly more input, but not too much. So I gave it, okay, here is the name and environment, and then prompted for give me the hash key name and key variant. I told it like lock ID and S should be it, and it gave so I think that will be a good shift shot, and it will include everything. Yes, I think that's good. And real time deployment progress in chat. So this one is same.

Suresh Attaluri  39:47  
The chart will show the chart from confirm, like, Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  39:52  
I think the GIF will begin with all of the previous screenshot. Screenshot, yeah, and. Begin with user entering

Suresh Attaluri  40:01  
confirming to create the confirming the import that user has provided,

Swarup Donepudi  40:08  
and then Stackdriver is shown will be triggered

Suresh Attaluri  40:11  
and the touching the GIF would be so basically, what we are doing is we are trying to break down the video content

Swarup Donepudi  40:17  
into smaller changes. What

Suresh Attaluri  40:21  
So, how about this part? So here we just Okay, here we just show that the starting point, right? Yeah, yeah, real time, deployment, progress,

Swarup Donepudi  40:36  
and we will show the full, full progress, not just like started. We'll show the whole thing. Yeah, we'll see. And then this is, this is a more, bigger area to show, a better this thing. So if we want to show a bigger image, full image of chat window versus just this one cannot include a bigger image, I guess. So. This is a place to do more images. That's all we can remove it. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  41:17  
yeah. Simplified permission, again. What is that? Simplified permission and access management. Oh, so

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
this is, I think I am trying to add there, I told you, right? So I'm asking I'm adding to the board for the stuff that we are claiming on the website to create content. So I think we didn't do anything here, like the either environment this thing or granting a team member a role is, is? Is what this was meant for. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  41:50  
we'll get to that. So basically, till now, we have already discussed provisioning. Part of provisioning has this is not a simple task. It has this guided experience thing. It has this benefit of stack job initiation and all those things. So that's when it got spilled over or split into these two parts. But simplified permission and access management is straightforward, straight forward, and

Swarup Donepudi  42:25  
we are also trying to break off the maybe, maybe we might be creating an impression. Candora can only do DevOps automation, but instead we are like saying that no ask for stuff outside the automation and plant over. Can help you.

Suresh Attaluri  42:46  
But is it okay? The initially we DevOps co pilot, and then when I go down, I was surprised. Oh, can you do this? I mean, as a user again,

Swarup Donepudi  42:57  
we don't have to do perfectionist there? Yeah, we think that's fine, as long as we want to demonstrate all of the capabilities we have built. And if the places where we are talking about those are not the most appropriate places, I'm saying that's okay. And same thing with seamless credential and connection sharing. And here I want to actually do a video,

Suresh Attaluri  43:25  
seamless credential and connection sharing. Okay, yeah, I am going to do

Swarup Donepudi  43:29  
a video, and I'm going to tell you the script right now, okay, and I'm going to first begin with my explaining on iPad. I love platform engineers. I love AWS icon, and I have developers. This is my first initial beginning of the iPad screen recording. And these platform engineers and developers will be like animated photos, like there is a icon store. I'm going to get a group of people and call them platform engineers, a group of people called developers, and there will be Google Cloud AWS and maybe Google Analytics cluster. So I'm going to begin by explaining the fact that these developers want to deploy resources to these AWS or Kubernetes or GCS account and platform engineers do have access to these directly, but those don't. So platform engineers will connect these to platinum cloud, and they will only allow the environments that need access to deploy, and the way to do that can be via plantora, and now I'm going to go to plantora, and as a platform engineer, I'm going to grant access for one of the environments to deploy to this. But using this command called hey, I want to share so and so credential and. And I will end it there, meaning I'm not going to prove that the credential has been shared. Blah, blah, blah. I'm going to emphasize on the fact that you can share, or you can this is how

Unknown Speaker  45:13  
plan you will get a response, yeah, I

Swarup Donepudi  45:15  
share. You share. Now developers who have access to this environment can proceed deploying to this AWS account because the platform engineer authorized them to do so, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  45:27  
so I see there are multiple video content, as when we talk about media on this page, I see two types of it. One is cloud video content and then for small contents which have G for screenshots, yeah. What do you think if we we decided that we will have one video at the top right instead of one video, how about we break it? Break these videos into smaller videos, like provisioning will be a video and granting access. Oh,

Swarup Donepudi  46:06  
so just make the landing page where there is buttons, buttons below. I think the more videos, the better. More videos

Suresh Attaluri  46:14  
in smaller more smaller videos is much better. However, let's Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  46:21  
let's, yeah, that's good.

Suresh Attaluri  46:28  
That's that's actually better to even begin. And we can in these subsections or page content. That's what we are calling it. We there. We can have a smaller form of media, which is a GIF for a screenshot. Yeah, so we tell most of our story at the top.

Swarup Donepudi  46:46  
That's better. So even for deciding on what be those smaller store videos, we should actually rely on these things only.

Suresh Attaluri  46:55  
Yeah, the sections you will learn anything new from the below page content. It's just a screenshot of, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  47:04  
no, even, even first to determine watch how many videos we want, we are going to rely on this content like first take, for example. For this one, will not have a separate video altogether. We'll move on, but guided resource creation. We'll say, we'll have one video just for guided resource creation.

Suresh Attaluri  47:26  
Yeah, this, this thing comes for all the three, right? Like boots,

Swarup Donepudi  47:34  
yeah, we can say, No, we should not combine, though, that's what I'm saying. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  47:39  
bootstrap will have a video, yeah, but Bootstrap has the ability of this guided resource creation, and also it has this real time deployment routers, yeah, so, so

Swarup Donepudi  47:50  
there, it should not be a one to one map, one to one map. That's what we can say. Bootstrap services, provision, infrastructure, provision infrastructure and access management,

Suresh Attaluri  48:01  
yeah, Access Manager three, and also what is the other one will build will might

Swarup Donepudi  48:10  
eventually come, and then maybe auditable intelligence and team transparency, saying whatever you are creating from the chat interface, it is transparent for the entire team. So that's one thing.

Suresh Attaluri  48:25  
This has to be here. We already have a section for it, right?

Swarup Donepudi  48:30  
Yeah, I think we will skip that part. Yeah, that's good. I think we don't want to put more concepts. Yeah, overall, we are not going to add and if at all is needed, we will put a screenshot of that credential sharing, video recording, chat window, whatever we show there, we'll put the final screenshot of the chat conversation as an image here, for simplicity, yeah. As for the video itself. The content is already explained in the video with titles.

Suresh Attaluri  49:05  
I think for chart, we can choose GIFs that would be better than screenshot the person entering something. The gifs also

Swarup Donepudi  49:15  
would require script, and we are not going to reinvent the script. We are going to reinvent the script. We are going to take the GIFs from the video itself. Yeah, okay, and we identified that the videos would be provision, cloud infrastructure, access management. I think Bootstrap is something that when we have

Suresh Attaluri  49:39  
but for now, there are two things that I'm looking at. One is for provision, and other,

Swarup Donepudi  49:43  
access management. That's it. We will not try. The key to success here is to not overburden ourselves with creating content because we lack experience there, and the more we commit to create. Creating the higher chance that we will fail. Yes. So I think whatever we discussed so far are still within the realm of our own skill set and tools that we have to achieve what is necessary. Just to conclude. So this one is good image. We are not going to touch this. This one will have a GIF. The Guided resource creation part will be a GIF, yeah. So this one the so the guided resource creation part will have a GIF cut from the same video recording, cut from the video recording, yeah, where we are going to show DynamoDB guided resource part. That's it now, scrolling up, so you can scroll up from here by pressing so, yeah, we as we scroll up the real time deployment Progress, also from the provisioning part, we are going to do a GIF. Yes, okay, and this, I think

Unknown Speaker  51:03  
we might have this thing right. I

Swarup Donepudi  51:08  
think more next page. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  51:10  
so when we include bootstrapping and all, like I was saying, the real, real time deployment progress and guided resources are more suitable for provisioning. We'll keep it like that, yeah, even though the chart naturally or has that feature of guided experience, we choose provision part of our platform to demonstrate

Swarup Donepudi  51:35  
the guided part. And then probably this part will be removed, yes, and we will replace it with, eventually, there is going to be more content in the form of bootstrapping and maybe operating etc, we'll add them. So for now, we'll remove this section, which is an empty Image section showing plant or a chat box. And even if it is there, we can probably show some other chat screenshot that's that's also way,

Unknown Speaker  52:02  
yeah, if I don't know

Swarup Donepudi  52:04  
the importance of this, I don't know design perspective, oh, sometimes what happens is, if you have a continuous series of these boxes, okay, it's like a cluttered space, okay, so introducing some space in here makes it less

Suresh Attaluri  52:20  
cluttered. It's something that is shot, yeah, so coming up, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  52:24  
And then simplified permission, my action management will also be a GIF cut from the video. So overall, the content on plant aura will be two videos, one showing provision, one showing access management. And we'll take GIFs from those videos to create the media for the rest of the page and for the these empty images, you still use a large screenshot. That's it. For the chat itself, showing something else, right we have. We can tell a different stories. It doesn't have to be related to this or the above stuff. It can simply be some random conversation in the chat that does something useful. Like, what can I think of is, for example, today I had an interesting conversation with plant. Or

Suresh Attaluri  53:13  
how would we show the combined conversation? Like, here we said that we'll have a GIF, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  53:19  
Or what I'm thinking is that larger area can be leveraged to show screenshots of smaller conversations. Okay, multiple resources, yeah, I wonder

Suresh Attaluri  53:33  
which we see blah, blah, so that should at the top we are saying you will have these guided experience and and real time charts, yeah, but you can have it for those

Swarup Donepudi  53:48  
are, like, just collage of various chats, yeah, lots of information saying, hey, I want to update, add a new DNS record, right today, I had an interesting conversation. I can show it to you, which I was, like, impressed, like I told, I said, I went to the GCP DNS zone. Okay, it's resource chat, okay. Oh, I we never talked about, oh, I think the plant over page needs to be updated with these new, two new features, which is, you can share chats with your team members. You have the chats co located alongside your resources. I'm kind of tired right now. It's a 54 minute conversation, but we will just have a brief conversation about the

Suresh Attaluri  54:35  
how we can position this part of it like it is still chat, but it is, it is next to your resources. You can just start, and

Swarup Donepudi  54:49  
your team is collaborating on that resource with you. Yeah, the chat is free of that particular deployment. Deployed resource is the. And your team is collaborating. Somebody comes into does something, somebody else comes in. So that's, that's the highlight, which is collaborate discussion. Will have one discussion where we dedicatedly talk about the APA resource chats, the importance of them, and the team collaboration aspect there, and locating the configuration right alongside and the bot will already know that you are talking about the it knows the context because it is right, and the shared chats where you can collaborate with your team on random aspects. So I think those two will be added as two separate sections on the plant aura Features page. Yes. Okay. Now I was talking about this interesting feature, right? So I said I wanted to update the configuration. Yeah, as well. I want to update the third record of the MX record to change it from one to eight, okay. I want to change the third value of MX record to replace with one to eight, okay. And it did give me, gave me the unified F. And I said, Yeah, but before proceeding, can you show me the full updated state? And it showed me the right value, okay, so yeah, this is, like, I felt very good because of, yeah. These are, like, not easy, and the fact that, and we didn't build for this, right? We didn't write any conditional to say if it is a list, and I was able to figure out smartly. So this has lots and lots of value, I felt. So, yeah, concluding, we will continue the discussion to discuss about those two. We'll have another discussion. I think we talked about everything else on the page, so that's a good discussion. Any closing remarks? No, can you stop i.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f1-plantora-2.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:10  
Okay, here we are another good, good morning. Okay, so with

Speaker 1  0:21  
our new setup, with the new setup, yeah, that's the exciting part.

Swarup Donepudi  0:25  
We have this new mic. Sennheiser, M, K, H, so we are hoping that the audio quality is going to be good, and sure she is more excited about about the new, new devices that have been added to the studio. And the purpose of this discussion this morning is so we were actually doing a video series on discussing all the aspects of with the features so with a goal to add media or create media. However, when we were talking about the feature page for plant or itself on on our design, we kind of like realized that this design does not include the new features that we have added after I handed off the requirements to or after I finalized the sections on this page, and I'm going to first open up The console app and go over what those features are here with Suresh, and we are going to essentially talk about why we added those features and what value anyone is going to get out of those features. And then use this, use the transcription or the use the this conversation as input to chat GPT to come up with or add more section to plantora feature page, and maybe we'll talk about the media for those features. Well, maybe we are going to probably cover that in the video itself.

Suresh Attaluri  2:20  
Right? I think we can talk about the journey, like, before showing it on the platform, okay, we ended up building that feature, like, Why? Why? Is a problem that we faced? Yeah. And maybe we

Swarup Donepudi  2:33  
should also talk about the feature that we already planned but haven't implemented it yet, which is the stack job summary, it's not it's right on the board. It's like, we want to leverage the same APA resource chats to also do stack job summary and have the provide the ability. So we dive into those duties. And just trying to remind that, because I just thought about it. So we started off this discussion, we only talked about sharing chats and ABA resources level chats, but stack job summaries and ability to converse on the stack job failures right within the chat is something that we plan in the pipeline. So we'll also talk about it. So yeah, where do you want to begin? Like, what? Why do you what prompted us to, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  3:23  
so those things, so we will our plant, the Chatbot, the Chatbot, yeah, and we're doing things at different levels, like we're provisioning resources, we're Testing and all we're doing all those stuff, but those charts, in a way, are isolated and only limited to the person who has requested the or created those charts. Yeah, and there's no aspect of collaborating with other team members, yeah, and we felt that collaboration is a thing that is needed, yeah, so that multiple peoples can put on their request in a single chat. Yeah, that's the whole intent. And

Swarup Donepudi  4:13  
for me, the what actually prompted or felt like this could make sense. Was every time I ran into some issue, I wanted, I was trying to create screenshots of that conversation and I was sharing with you same thing. I thought same thing would be the case even within the future customers of us, where one developer is trying to do something in their chat and and they want to share the conversation with another fellow developer. And I always felt like chatgpt itself should have added this feature, because I always wanted to collaborate with our team on chatgpt. So since we have the opportunity, and I felt like it was a low hanging fruit, so it is both like value adding and also easy to roll out for us, so that that is when I

Suresh Attaluri  5:07  
also want to highlight the we have not we have identified two levels of collaboration. One is a user intentionally sharing a chat, yeah. And there is another level of collaboration, which is at the resource level, yeah, where anything happens at the resource level? Chat,

Swarup Donepudi  5:26  
yeah. So when you say resource, you're talking about any multi cloud deployment,

Suresh Attaluri  5:30  
deployment. AP, yeah, deployment component, any deployed resource, yeah, yeah, will have a chat associated with it, okay? And any, anything, any request put over there will be communicated or will be shown to sorry.

Swarup Donepudi  5:53  
Everyone can access conversation. It's not intentionally, anyone sharing anything, the very default nature of those conversations, they begin right close to where the deployment configuration can be found on the console app, and the conversation is going to live there, so anyone who has access to that configuration can also Explore historical conversation that happened on that resource. Right? So

Suresh Attaluri  6:24  
users of those charts, I mean resource levels, specific chairs should be aware that whatever is put over here will be broadcasted to all the users who have access to that that resource. So that's, yeah, this share chat feature is more individual preference.

Swarup Donepudi  6:46  
I noticed another difference between these individuals starting conversation process, the conversations that happen at the APA resource level or the deployed resource level, is in order for the resource, in order for deployment to happen, say, for example, I want to deploy a Redis Database on Google Redis, before that creation deployment happens, that deployment doesn't exist, right? So it's not possible to have a conversation on something that doesn't exist. So the creation workflows may happen or begin at individual, individual level once the resource, once something gets deployed, now the configuration exists, and during the life cycle operations, or during the life cycle of that deployment, any configuration of deaths can live close to that. So that is one of the observation that I made, and another one is, yeah, another observation was, whenever you begin a conversation about any deployed resource, say you want to update the configuration or you want to rerun an IAC stack for that particular resource, for whatever reason, etc. First of all, you need to give provide the context to the Chatbot about which deployed resource you want. You want to you're talking about, right? But when you go and start the conversation right at the deployment, deployed resource, yeah, you don't have to provide the traditional

Suresh Attaluri  8:20  
context that's already there. Yeah, that's already there. That's the difference, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  8:24  
So you directly go and express your intention, as opposed to, if you are doing the conversation as an individual, first of all, you, let me say, hey, I want to do something x on some resource. So bot needs to First, identify, look it up, identify, confirm, so all of that can be avoided if you the depth collaborate,

Suresh Attaluri  8:44  
right? Yeah, as a platform owner, I believe we would recommend to use this resource level charts for all resource level operations, rather than individual charts. But we are not

Swarup Donepudi  8:57  
restricting them together. It's a recommendation,

Suresh Attaluri  9:01  
because you don't need to set the context. You don't, and the broadcasting part you it is automatically said to everyone. Everyone is informed looking at the chart, but when it comes to individual chart, you hide certain details, like people won't be informed, yeah, is they will have the version history and other features, but in short, they might not be, yeah, that's the switch.

Swarup Donepudi  9:29  
Let's see how the audio is going to change. Yeah, okay, so now that we went over, let's see that in action. Is that fine?

Unknown Speaker  9:40  
Yes, I think

Swarup Donepudi  9:41  
we talked about the whys. Now let's see the how. So, yeah, so individual conversations can be explored from ask by clicking on Ask plan, and this is where you see both the chats that I started, the conversations that I began. And this icon indicates the chats that I shared with others. And these are the chats that I am a guest, meaning somebody invited me to collaborate, right? So if I scroll back up, the first message is always a good indication of who started it, because that's the person moving inside. So in this case, is most likely you, I guess, or Satish. This is Satish, yes, and this is you, obviously so. And as you can see, because this is a collaborative, shared chat, I was able to also, it's important to understand that any conversation that happens in this collaboration, or even at the resource level chats, every single message is, is going to be processed or responded by what, no matter what. So the these are, these chats are not meant for, like, regular conversations that are that happen typically in a Slack channel, right? Yeah. So,

Suresh Attaluri  11:04  
whether anything, I mean, even though, if a single chart is shared across multiple people, if they are adding some message to the chat, yeah, they're actually talking to the bot, not to not with the person who is with whom the chart is shared, yeah? Like, that's a whole. I mean, we don't see that as a feature, right? We don't see that is required, like, if, if we both are in a single chat, and I want to address you and say something to the person. This is not the place for you to put that. This is purely to talk to

Swarup Donepudi  11:51  
the board. Yeah. And sharing the chat is pretty straightforward. Wherever you're talking, you can look up the member that you want to share the chat with and there is the sharing is not limited to organizations, or is it? It is all it is. Share chats with other members in your own organization, but not others. Yeah, so depending on which organization you it's in the context. But it doesn't matter if the environment, is the context, right?

Unknown Speaker  12:24  
Yeah, I think I should check that. But

Swarup Donepudi  12:25  
ideally, you can be able to do it with anyone

Suresh Attaluri  12:30  
in the organization only, yeah? Sharing thing, okay, yeah, okay, the chat can only be shared to. Another member who's in the same organization.

Swarup Donepudi  12:46  
Yeah, you can develop. I can type in the email address of anyone. Yeah, for example, if I want to share this chat with Satish,

Suresh Attaluri  12:57  
yeah, you're getting Satish email id recommendation is because they belong to this. Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  13:03  
Also, we forgot about the teams aspect, yes. So you can share the chat with the entire team without having to invite each so this is very powerful feature to me, like if you want to collaborate with and bring everyone on your team. So that's, again, very powerful addition to the mix. So yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's good. So let's now go to the resource level chat. So I am on an AWS DynamoDB table that I deployed yesterday. And yeah, I can do ask plantora, and I can go back to the history of this conversation. And as you can see, I already made a few changes. Not even made a few changes. I started by asking, Why is the last time job failing? I saw that, and it says, I need the stack job ID. I said, Can you look it up from the details? And it says, I currently do not have the capability to look up in saddle. I said, the stack job ID is in straighter section of the API resource. And it did look it up and and then I said, Okay, now that you know, I asked, Did you find it out? By the way, it says, Please hold on for a moment. And I was, I was surprised that it would come back with another message. But that doesn't happen,

Suresh Attaluri  14:31  
right? Oh, that doesn't happen. I don't know why it is asking, yeah, did you find out?

Swarup Donepudi  14:39  
And yeah, I just waited for a couple seconds, and I asked you to find out, and then it actually came back by looking up the details of that stack job ID and figured out from the error messages that, oh, this is what is causing the failure, and here is how you can fix it. So overall, as like, what we are trying to discuss here is the advantage of resource level chance, and anyone who has access, which can be discovered by going to the permissions management and we say, Show inherited permissions, and yeah, like All these different people have access to this resource, yeah, so the

Suresh Attaluri  15:23  
organization level? Yeah, that is where we they can, since they have a organization, but they can see that, yeah, this

Swarup Donepudi  15:32  
is probably a discussion for a different Yeah. But is this intuitive? Is my question. We'll talk about it when we talk about IAM, but going back, yeah, overall, anyone who has access to just look up the detail you permission to say resource can access this entire chat, and they can start the conversation, and what they can perform on this resource totally depends on what kind of permissions that particular identity has on that resource. So just because you have access to this chat doesn't mean you can deploy. You can undeploy this resource. You need to have appropriate permissions to on deploy. So if you if you come here and say and deploy, and if you don't have permissions to do that, the system will deny that request automatically.

Suresh Attaluri  16:22  
The beauty of this individual charts is now I can continue the chart where you have left, like, figure out the root cause. Now I it's not required for me to start the whole chart from the beginning, yeah. I can start where it was left, and I can try to fix this issue, right? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:41  
yeah. This is definitely another powerful feature. So now we move on to the third aspect of this discussion that we wanted to talk, which was, Okay, interesting I'm unable to navigate to the that's a Bucha. Okay, so another area where we have already planned and we haven't actually rolled out this additional collaboration aspect of these chats is as soon as whether a pulumi or a telephone stack execution is completed, our system will automatically do a summary of what happened as part of that Stackdriver, and make that as a summary for here and the developers, or anyone who is who is a stakeholder of that particular deployment, they can start conversations on the summary itself, and we, we are, those are that is also essentially an API resource level chat, the APA resource here being the stack job itself,

Suresh Attaluri  17:53  
yeah. But this has to be handled somewhat different, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  17:58  
Experience is going to be different, as opposed to having a conversational deployed resource versus this, these are not at resource level. These are at the stack job level. We are the scope. The chart is only scoped for that particular stand job. Yes.

Suresh Attaluri  18:15  
So initially, the only difference that I see is initially, when we create a chart for AWS DynamoDB resource as as a platform, we are doing nothing, nothing, yeah, but when we talk about stack job, yeah, so we are triggering some analysis

Swarup Donepudi  18:32  
to follow up on your thought of like, who, when is that conversation on an API resource or a deployed component begins is when the first message is like, the developer will start. The conversation will always begin when a developer wants to have a conversation, whereas with stack job, it's a asynchronous,

Suresh Attaluri  18:57  
the initial conversation will be started by the platform

Swarup Donepudi  19:01  
plan control the back end, and then the developers can continue that conversation by asking more questions around the summary itself. Yes, and we want to make these tag job summaries and the follow up conversations to be far more effective by making or by enabling the chat bot, or by providing chat bot with all the necessary context to provide as much relevant response as possible. And when I say more context, I'm talking about all the input that was used to run the stack job and the pulumi or TerraForm code that was used to execute that stack job as input, the system has all of that information, but we need to enable the bot. We need to build that capability into the bot to bring all of this information so that the bot can provide will have more context. For example, if it is an error, then bot will look at the input. Bot will look at the COVID or TerraForm code, and it has a better chance of identifying what could have caused that failure. Yes, so I believe that is another huge value that we can provide to the developers, because deployment values are one of the biggest frustration causing areas, and we have an opportunity to solve it very effectively. So I think that definitely concludes

Suresh Attaluri  20:35  
our I think this feature also comes under that operate part, because I'm trying to deploy something.

Swarup Donepudi  20:43  
Operators, again, more more or less is post deployment. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  20:47  
this is

Swarup Donepudi  20:53  
more of a deployment support, yeah. So, I mean, typically, like walk, who would have solved this is developer would reach out to a DevOps engineer or somebody who has created the module, and then they'll say, Hey, I ran the job and it is failing. I don't understand. In most cases, developers don't or they are not approved with the right knowledge to be safer. Those other messages and get to the root cause of it. So it's usually the engagement with the DevOps or support engineer. So that's that's also a lot of bottleneck. They wait for somebody to look at her. I've seen this first time at CDP, and then something fails. They ask me, I walk through my queue. So they wait until I get to that. So all of this is avoided with real time. Do you have any more concluding comments on on these particular aspects?

Suresh Attaluri  21:50  
No, I think okay, so I think we need to discuss how this whole feature is going to be shipped out on

Swarup Donepudi  21:58  
the landing page. Yeah, I think all of these conversations were so, yeah, this concluding notes is for chatgpt, and essentially, I'm going to share the existing sections of this finalized plantora Features page, and I'm going to share the transcript of our previous conversation, where we talked about the media for each of the sections, and then I'm going to share the transcription for this conversation where we talked about the capabilities that we have added after the previous page was finalized, And the expectation from chatgpt is to add more sections to the page talking about these three different aspects and and also, I think this page is missing the important of the important aspects. I think it does make simplified permission to access management is probably, I think I went to discuss, or maybe I don't know. So overall, one of the aspects of this chat conversation is that it's the bot is built in such a way that,

Suresh Attaluri  23:20  
until now, when we talked about in this space, yeah, we talked about the intents that plant dollar chart can solve, yeah, like when we talked about the guided generation and access management is, it's more about what you can do with this thing. Yeah, this feature sharing charts is, I don't know. It's not about intent anyway. This is, it's more

Swarup Donepudi  23:45  
like providing more value

Suresh Attaluri  23:50  
to the how you can collaborate with

Swarup Donepudi  23:52  
collaboration is, yes, and one of the aspects that I find missing on this page is that all the chat conversations are I am protected, meaning you can ask whatever you feel like asking, but bot will ensure that it will only execute the steps that you are authorized to execute. Yes, if you have get access on any resource, and if you would like to look up the details, bot would show that information. But if you don't have update permissions on any resource, even the guided like the update workflow will not work, because, again, you will not have

Suresh Attaluri  24:37  
access to that. So I believe chat GPT is going to give the section, section title some subtitles for this new feature. But I think we still need to figure out the media, media, right?

Swarup Donepudi  24:53  
So media is again going to be, oh yeah, I think the first section we talked about two videos that we want to say. One is access provision. The first part is provision. Second one is access management. And I think I can cover the this. I am permissions aspect in access management itself, like there are various parts of it, which is platform engineers sharing connections with environments. They can do it from here, okay, and members can add other members to their team from the chat, unrelated to provisioning, but still related to access management, and then also highlighting the fact that the board is always aware of the permissions that the user has to perform any operation that's and we are going to add third sections in collaboration.

Unknown Speaker  25:50  
Yeah, third video for collaboration, collaboration. And

Swarup Donepudi  25:53  
do you think we should add a fourth video talking about the value for deployments assistance, like stack job insights or that's also collaboration in a way, but it also has the added benefit, which is not

Suresh Attaluri  26:09  
applied To API resources like we discussed earlier, also true. It falls under the category, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  26:24  
maybe we can record that video and put it on both pages. That's also one option.

Unknown Speaker  26:32  
We'll see, we'll see, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  26:33  
But overall, I think it falls in both Yeah, but

Suresh Attaluri  26:38  
as media fit, we will have a video,

Swarup Donepudi  26:40  
yeah, I think you're right that should actually go on that page. They integrated IAC workflows or whatever, because that's more like we are giving you a workflow, and it runs instantly. You get to see the days all that. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  26:57  
when we talk about chat, the power of chat is to understand your reading letters and deliver, deliver, yeah, and making you have that less learning curve or less Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  27:09  
yeah. Maybe we talked about the provisioning part in the beginning, right? Maybe we can add a line or two saying, yeah, if you the summary, start your phase, you you get the summary. Will just mention it, but will not go dive deeper into it, meaning we don't have to make a separate video for it. You can include of doing the provisioning partners, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  27:32  
The theme of this feature should be more of chat, chat, where user is expressing even their intent or request,

Swarup Donepudi  27:43  
what to do, collaborating with the how is

Suresh Attaluri  27:45  
the chart? Responding? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  27:48  
I would, I would start to call plant or collaborating with or engaging with the developer, because we are saying that right, like either platform engineer ready to help 24/7, so I'm thinking plant a as a persona, as a chat bot. So we can say developer expresses his intent to plant Ara, and plant Ara will work with the developer to get to make sure he gets what he needs. Yeah, I think cool. So

Suresh Attaluri  28:24  
we decided that we'll going to add a third collaboration part of chat. And, okay, yeah, let's discuss the script, also one script, then we can discuss the the media is at the bottom before

Swarup Donepudi  28:42  
we cannot talk about the media without the sections finalized. Okay, those sections and the subtitles are required, so we'll only talk about the video and we'll talk about the sections also finalized. So yeah, what do you think might make a good two or three minute video showing off the collaboration aspects of chat feature.

Suresh Attaluri  29:07  
We'll start from that, that part where we have in the provision video we might have created, we had a script of creating some resource, right? We'll continue. We'll continue from there. Hey, now I want to share this. I want, I want a fellow developers opinion on whether what, what should be the right value here, yeah, so I'll invite him to this chat, and we both are an individual chat, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  29:32  
that would be an individual. Yeah, you're still creating it.

Suresh Attaluri  29:39  
We can do it for a individual or a team? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  29:44  
I think we need to explicitly call out that aspect so that. So I want chatgpt to know that we want to include that highlighting the aspect that you can I can invite either my fellow developer, or I can invite my entire team using the notion of teams on random cloud, and they can come and collaborate. Now we'll show, we'll have

Suresh Attaluri  30:07  
two sections of users. Yeah, we'll show the other guys. Now I want to see, I

Swarup Donepudi  30:12  
think that's probably going to be tough

Suresh Attaluri  30:15  
to record. Yeah, Okay, how about we have two screens side by side, half of the screen being user one, half of the screen being user

Swarup Donepudi  30:25  
two, yeah, I think the icon login has two different users. Yeah, I can do that, and

Suresh Attaluri  30:30  
we'll show that this chat is not yet shared. Now it is shared. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  30:35  
for that, I need to fix a bug, like when two sessions are open, there is a bug that is preventing messages. I need to write it out, but that will force me to fix it as, yeah, that's a good demo. I

Suresh Attaluri  30:53  
want to invite that. This will be the individual part of the sharing, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  30:58  
and then the same

Suresh Attaluri  31:00  
resource. We'll jump on to individual API, resource level chat. We'll try to modify something and see if the other users, yeah, they refer to the

Swarup Donepudi  31:14  
page, or they go to the same chat, and they see that I have just made some modification, and he gets to see that we

Suresh Attaluri  31:23  
can, we can do this thing like user one is requesting for a modification. Yeah, plan tour will ask for final confirmation that this is the change. That's how the guided experience is. And then the confirmation should be given by the second user to do the journey. So then

Swarup Donepudi  31:41  
I mentioned, while recording the video, that I pinned my developer on Slack, asking for his contribution. So he jumped on to the API resource and looked at the chat. He reviewed it. Now he says, proceed, and the body is going to proceed with the next steps. I think that's a good small script that can explain the overall capability there. Yes, and then

Suresh Attaluri  32:08  
nothing. We should also, okay, this collaboration will put it in the individual level chat only. Sorry, API resource level chats. We won't do that multiple thing in the individual, yeah. I think individual chat is good enough. When someone shares, the other person is able to see the chat, see the chat there, ends the individual

Swarup Donepudi  32:29  
there. Maybe we can simply say, Maybe we should know, change, like, set the CPU limit to, like, 400 rather 300 just one message, just to say they can collaborate on

Suresh Attaluri  32:47  
the user too. Yeah, with whom the chat was shared, they will. Yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  32:54  
we'll see that doesn't matter. I guess whatever we are already showing is definitely a step improvement. So people, as long as they understand the overall collaboration, they it makes sense that they can, we can only say that the now they can collaborate too. So it's okay to, like, not show everything you skip the stack jobs, collaboration here. What do you think? Yes, yeah, it's not. Collaboration is not the key, right there is it's going to be around the developer doing something to resolve his own deployment. But as per, the team has access to the chat, but it doesn't. I think we can sell a stack

Suresh Attaluri  33:36  
job level. It's less of a collaboration resource is stack job is life of charge less, right? Because a new stack job, we can be triggered and the a PhD resource state gets changed. So I believe stack job charts will have less conversations over there. Yeah, but more of analysis, friend,

Swarup Donepudi  34:02  
explain. Successful. Nobody even looks at what happened,

Suresh Attaluri  34:08  
right? Yeah, they just expect to consume some information or what is the issue and how can they fix it? That's what. And rather than putting more collaborating, adding more messages or having any more conversations,

Swarup Donepudi  34:23  
I think that's a good 35 minute discussion. We think this is all sufficient for me to get to finalize the additional sections with their titles and subsections, and also the script with all the steps. And once the script is ready and once we get the subsections, we'll probably take just screenshots or gifs of the same showing the same stuff, and put it next to these subsections. Awesome. That's a great discussion. Thanks for collaborating once again. Suresh, you have always been a great

Suresh Attaluri  34:56  
teammate. Likewise. Thank you likewise, much. Do


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f2.self-service-devops.p1.history.md
Suresh Attaluri  0:10  
Okay, Suresh, would you like to begin?

Suresh Attaluri  0:17  
Yeah, so this is about service, self service DevOps feature page in our website. So as a feature name, like I said, self service DevOps, we need to finalize the other sections of this page, the first being title hero section, or hero section, right now we have it as unleashed, developer autonomy with self service, DevOps, okay, in general. When we also discussed about other pages, I was not looking at any meaning of this hero section, this thing, I believe that's what for you as it is more a flashy line,

Swarup Donepudi  1:08  
catchy sales oriented lines. Okay, so

Suresh Attaluri  1:11  
unless developer autonomy with self service, DevOps and this, these few words, doesn't make sense to me, I don't know what to take from this, but if you're good with it, yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  1:25  
given our own experiences around work experience, it is difficult for us to come up with those statements in the first place. Okay? So all we can definitely do is talk about or what the problem is about, discuss the solution in great detail, and hand off the actual requirement to chat GPT saying we are building a sales website, okay? And here are the most important sections on our website, and one of them is self service, DevOps. Here is a detailed transcription about what it is, why we built it. What does it do? Etc, etc. Can you give me three or four hero section titles and subtitles? I chose what I felt like is the best way. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  2:10  
on hindsight, if when I again read this thing, it tells the story, also unleashing developer autonomy is empowering developer with this evolve service DevOps or tools that we are provided through planet cloud, right? Like, yeah, it is not that out of the line as well, unrelated as well. Yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  2:33  
the Excel that we did is exactly what I said and I chose what I felt like was the most appropriate, or what might kind of express the meaning. So chose those and yeah, and because these are concepts for us, like, for example, self service DevOps is a concept I don't know if there is a even I remember you asking me or telling me that you don't understand what what self service DevOps means exactly a year, a year ago when we first talked about it. Yeah, right. So you were completely unfamiliar with the whole concept, and the more we talked about it,

Suresh Attaluri  3:09  
I'm still skeptical about what I don't have its clear definition, but there's no clear definition in the market as well. It

Swarup Donepudi  3:18  
is hard to come up with what is appropriate when there is no clear definition, yeah? So

Suresh Attaluri  3:23  
yeah, in this recording, we'll try to figure out a definition in plant and clouds context, yeah, we'll do that, yeah. What is self search those but before

Swarup Donepudi  3:33  
that exercise has already been done, okay? And this output is an out. This is an outcome of that exercise, yeah, but we have another opportunity with where you and I are, yes, yes. The previous time it was me explaining the solution to chatgpt. This is more of a discussion, so I think maybe better another we can that exercise itself is very easy, yeah, I taking the transcript and asking for So, yeah, we can do 10 and shot

Suresh Attaluri  4:03  
on. How about the subtitle part where it says, empower your team to build, deploy scale faster than ever with land and clouds AI driven self service solutions? Yeah. It tells about, uh, would. I don't see any problem with the with that sentence,

Swarup Donepudi  4:28  
we can move on. These don't have to be perfect, yes,

Suresh Attaluri  4:32  
and they're serving them, they will keep scrolling down. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  4:35  
they'll be able to understand or get the gist of what it is all about. Yes, they keep going like every sentence in isolation does not have to convey a full meaning. Okay, yeah, so, so down. This is

Suresh Attaluri  4:51  
like a hint to what we can show like any other page we have the we need to figure out the video section of it, right?

Swarup Donepudi  4:58  
Yeah, yes. So

Suresh Attaluri  5:02  
then comes the question, like defining self service DevOps in plant and cloud context, what is self which part of plant and clouds project will be considered as self service DevOps? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  5:19  
so I think a little bit of context there is we chose to build. I mean ignoring all of the historical context on how we arrived at building, what is built today. Okay, ultimately, we identified ourselves or associated our product under the category of internal developer platforms? Yes, and one of the core tenets for any internal developer platform is to enable developers to fulfill their requirements, which have been classified classically put under DevOps requirements. These internal developer platforms enable developers to self self service their own requests. So classic examples would be, I want to deploy my micro service onto wherever, whether it is simple virtual machine, or whether it is a Kubernetes as a micro service, or whether it is a simple container running on AWS, CCS, or even if it is a lambda function, and if it is a solo developer working on his own idea, then there is no concept of DevOps, but this product or internal developer platforms are, like, built with things in mind, right? So, there is developers, there is DevOps. And the way this developer, DevOps landscape has evolved was previously, these two groups used to be completely isolated. There is absolutely no collaboration the code, and they simply hand it off to another team, and they take care of building, and then they take care of deploying, and simply they can provide a confirmation back, saying, Yes, we deployed it to so and so environment. Please go ahead and test. Yeah, so. But in between 2020, 13 and 2018 2019 ish, there was a shift of mindset there, saying, Let's make portion of this self service. So self service has been around for a while, to be frank. So what they what happened is a set of tools have been created, like, for example, GitLab, okay, where developer is writing code and then the build automation and deployment automation sat alongside the code that use. That never used to be the case until like these tools came around, Jenkins and GitLab, pipelines, etc. Developers write code, they don't see any automation running immediately as soon as they push the code. Okay, but notice how things have evolved from 2013 to 2019 where developer is making a comment and he's already seeing some automation run. So now developer is exposed to the next steps after development. Okay, so that shift in, or the transformation, has been classically referred to as DevOps, meaning the operations will help developers to experience it, meaning you can commit the code and you will see automation running, and you will be able to know whether the build ran fine or not. That itself is a is one way of self service. So

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
giving control to developers for operations part so operation, but it's a collaboration through a commit or through some way of developers clicking on a button, and that triggers, triggering some other interface. It could be any other interface, but

Swarup Donepudi  9:03  
I can construct that statement is developers, let's collaborate and collaborate or not like the steps after development. That's how I can see it, whether it is clicking a button or pushing a commit. Those are all triggers of how the automation gets triggered, but don't just your role will not end as soon as you commit the

Suresh Attaluri  9:27  
code or push the code. What is the collaboration part here?

Swarup Donepudi  9:30  
So developer will say, Hey, I'm building a Java project. Okay? And DevOps engineers will be like, Okay, let me do some commits to your own repository, which will create the automation. And there is this new wave of tools starting from that 22,010, and beyond, okay, which kind of enabled that whole idea of, okay, two people are collaborating on particular service, yeah, okay, so I would stop the service. I collaborate with you. You kind of make some changes, and you add automation to the repository. Every time I make the changes, you tell me what is going to happen. And as a DevOps engineer, you would come to me and be like, Yeah, as soon as you commit, I made sure that the Build step will run and the test, test step will also run, and they also wrote the automation to automatically deploy something. Yeah, here the collaboration party is definitely developer, is now aware of the like talking to the DevOps that never used to be the case before.

Suresh Attaluri  10:33  
Earlier there was, I mean, the conventional way also has collaboration, but it's more on handovering it to the other team and not caring about how it is put over there. And also, for every release the developer the dev team should have will be dependent, will be dependent on that other team's availability. And they need to schedule a time to deploy their version of the software, software block, they're waiting, they're waiting on the other team. And that's a problem solved 10 years back, and

Swarup Donepudi  11:11  
I was made to solve the problem, and those attempts were have been classically referred to as there should be collaboration. It's not a technology problem, it's a cultural problem. These two groups of teams should not work in isolation. Yeah, let's bring those two teams together, and then a suite of tools kind of entered the market that enhanced this collaboration. And those are the tools that I talked about, Jenkins and these, these don't have any meaning in the previous world where there was no collaboration in the first place. So first culturally, some evolution came around, yeah. And then tools followed, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  11:51  
So this, in this workflow, which you said, with the new tools of DevOps, I see that also, that as well as self service, right, automation has been provided by this DevOps or this operations team developers, is using that automation. I believe that's the high level fund of the whole workflow, yes,

Swarup Donepudi  12:20  
at the same time, something else also started happening, which is adoption of cloud increased and Kubernetes. Adoption of Kubernetes, Kubernetes became the and adoption of cloud increased, adoption of containers increased. Kubernetes became the default de facto container orchestration tool. So what seemed like a good self service solution in 2012 2013 okay? Is that model or framework could not apply to this new shift that was happening, which is okay. What happened when cloud adoption increased is the cacd automation is no longer about just deploying services. These developers now started asking for more. Like, for example, when in data centers, developers never thought about the possibility of requesting for another, say, a volume, okay, so those are all, like, kind of abstracted, those are data centers, and so you, you kind of build and deploy that, then you're talking about static, the

Suresh Attaluri  13:33  
you're talking about the provisioning of infrastructure, right,

Swarup Donepudi  13:38  
okay, not provisioning of infrastructure manages services. So the whole idea of DevOps, when it began, the environments were very static, meaning the organization has one dev environment, right? Like every service that is perceived as dev goes and sits on one piece of infrastructure, and those are long lived, and there is a team who maintains that. Okay? So there is this automation team, release team, used to call it, before DevOps. And then there is infrastructure team. Now with cloud, that infrastructure team itself became less relevant because they are not doing a lot the data center like the cloud abstracted away a lot of those they don't need to maintain, yeah? Like now they are not the clear owners there, yeah, do you even the these people are capable of getting what they need without these the infrastructure experts, right? So now deals can, like request for more, okay, okay, so same, same problem with deploying their own services. They need to deploy their services, but they were asking for mail stream to do it. This. That problem kind of was partially solved with DevOps tooling, where you make a comment, you push it. So that framework applied very well for that, but now cloud, when cloud came around, you could ask for another RDS instance. So it is those, it's not infrastructure. To me, infrastructure, as has always been, more of like, I need compute, I need storage, though, that is infrastructure. Whereas you are asking for a database, is not infrastructure, software infrastructure, maybe so, yeah. Overall, this DevOps CICD started becoming more complex and less efficient for these expanded requirements, with Kubernetes entering into the scene now that became much more like, yeah. I think the whole domain of self service just from being I want a self service just building and deploying my service to some unknown static server, okay, to Okay. I want this self service to also expand to provisioning cloud infrastructure, deploying resources on managed services and deploying services on Kubernetes, etc, etc. What

Suresh Attaluri  16:08  
are managed services? Can you give an example

Swarup Donepudi  16:12  
database on MongoDB, MongoDB a class, okay. Snowflake,

Suresh Attaluri  16:16  
okay. The now these have become the responsibilities of the obscure, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:24  
but, but that's that's a bottleneck,

Suresh Attaluri  16:26  
and we haven't talked about how that is being self serve. We only talked about the self service part, where user has to deploy their services, service, build and deploy for those Jenkins and all these tools are there, and self service has been set up. So now we're talking about next side of self service that we expect from ops, which is provisioning, say a database. Say a database. Yeah, provisioning infrastructure is one side. I don't think provisioning infrastructure also has been self service. I think with the cloud, with Cloud employees now that we

Swarup Donepudi  17:12  
are discussing like I I feel like the interesting part that is not very obvious, is I think what happened during this period is also like everything from being the way all of this got created has transformed into becoming an API, course. Okay, yeah, so that actually opened up opportunity for more solutions capabilities. When you can put something behind an API, obviously you can build a front end so ask for anything you want. It can now. It is possible from, say, 2018, and beyond, when Kubernetes started, like becoming more commonplace. COVID is everything is an API. All cloud providers, anything you deploy, is an API. So when there is an API, why can't you build a front end and make the consumption more self service before then nobody can ask for it, because those are not APS getting a database on a virtual machine, or a VMware

Suresh Attaluri  18:25  
or VMware setup. Those

Swarup Donepudi  18:28  
are those technologies are not API friendly. Those

Suresh Attaluri  18:31  
discussions would have happened offline, somehow, like in the same same case, where internal teams, like developers and operations, if they have to communicate, they might have used some emails or any other systems, but there's no automatic system automation.

Swarup Donepudi  18:47  
Nobody thought about it. Nobody can think of it like, since VMware never prioritized building APIs on top of their application, right? They're like, here is a GUI. Your operators can click those buttons and they can get there what they want. Now, make your developer talk to the operator. He clicks the buttons on the UI, he gets it what? But with evolution of cloud and with evolution of Kubernetes, APIs became like a more meaningful way to deploy anything, because that's how stuff gets deployed anyway, whether it is your operator via UI or whether it is Kubernetes, everything is API right when there is APIs, developers can now build a tooling around it,

Suresh Attaluri  19:30  
so now I see again, as opportunity of self service here, Also, like in case of Jenkins or the service layer, be it cloud or not cloud, they can still automate it. They can still put it on there. But the other side of of the spectrum where we are talking about provisioning things, infrastructure or other open source software for managed services Cloud has played a main role in allowing our teams to provide these self service automation Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  20:12  
it became possible. It became possible. So and also again, another on the other side of the spectrum. There is, it is okay to release your software every three months. Was acceptable in 2010 Okay, yeah, come to 2020 unless you're moving at like good pace, your competitors will outsmart you. Like, for example, take plant acloud, right? If we kind of build some one feature in chat bot and release it in next quarter, we are already way behind our next content is always breathing down the neck, right, whether it is passes or COVID, we know that they will set things up for faster development. So we need to also make sure that our development cycles are much, much faster. So the technology landscape itself has become so competitive this the ability for developers to roll out features and build features has become like a critical requirement for businesses. Yes, okay, but how, how can a developer building features for a developer today is not just about writing few lines of code anymore. Like, for example, you built the DevOps like the chat bot, right? You needed Elastic Search at some point, you needed a MongoDB. At some point you deployed our authorization using open FGA unit and a Postgres database. You didn't ask anybody, right? That is how you are able to quickly, kind of make progress, right? Today, to me, that is the reason why there is value for like, more efficient self service capabilities. In order to stay competitive, you need to enable your developers to move fast. And building features is no longer just even I only mentioned about these open source deployments. But think of like if our tech stack is different, and if you are committed to using everything on GCP, right? You would require a memory store, or you would need a storage bucket. So, yeah, I think this is,

Suresh Attaluri  22:29  
I think we established the problem that self service is needed, yeah. I mean, developers can't keep on waiting for other teams to get the get their software requirements ready for them. So, so what is the form of this self service? How? How did this? I mean, there, there is a positive, there is a problem, there is a possibility through cloud. And how did they solve the self service, DevOps? I mean, initially I believe, since we are talking about the journey, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  23:04  
so my observation was like, because I was in DevOps space for during this course of time, and I was seeing firsthand how the tools kind of kept evolved. So I think the first wave of self service was mostly centered around Kubernetes. Kubernetes, Kubernetes, because, because, I think Kubernetes became the de facto, okay, and because Kubernetes is all APIs, but lots and lots

Suresh Attaluri  23:34  
of but what happened before Kubernetes? I think cloud was there cloud was the first thing that came up, right? Like Kubernetes was later point,

Swarup Donepudi  23:45  
same thing as free before Jenkins days. What was only so

Suresh Attaluri  23:50  
similarly, this self service was not fully set up, I believe, or Yeah, people still used to go dependent, depend on the operations there. And

Swarup Donepudi  24:06  
there is a, there are a lot of places where devs are given full control or access to the console console app, and they were asked to create assuming that AWS console itself is a self service dashboard.

Suresh Attaluri  24:20  
Okay, that's yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:22  
you can think of, you can

Suresh Attaluri  24:23  
think of it like, Yeah, but why to wait for the ops people?

Swarup Donepudi  24:28  
Yeah, he has already built

Suresh Attaluri  24:30  
nice uA. I have similar experience in CDK as well. Yeah, we were given the console a cloud account, yeah, and we were asked to create the request. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:44  
that is self service, right? What is, what? Ultimately, what the self services let the developers build, what create, what they need to roll out features as fast as possible, yes, without having to understand the intricacies. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  24:59  
Now you're talking about Kubernetes. So how did Kubernetes solve it?

Swarup Donepudi  25:04  
Kubernetes didn't solve the self service. All

Suresh Attaluri  25:07  
of self I was always thinking, Kubernetes is to deploy this service. But when you're when you brought up Kubernetes in this context of deploying other softwares. It's not for services, will, in house services or the software will.

Swarup Donepudi  25:31  
I'm trying to think out loud as to,

yeah, I think I would, I would probably go back and watch the video discussion between the guy Rohit recommended right. Rohit recently recommended that he put us in touch with one person who is a technology analyst in this space, Cloud Platform engineering space, okay, I don't think I can put it anything better than him, okay, so what he was saying was the DevOps self service via like the Jenkins, etc, became complicated and the devs who is wanting just a URL to access I commit code, okay, give me a URL to access my service, yeah, kind of something like that. This was great in pre Jenkins era, where devs give code to ops, and ops say, Yeah, I deployed your WAR file. This is the URL where you can access so he says it was nice back in the day, it was slow, but devs want to focus on writing code. There was an ops team, okay? Who did what they need? They give back the URL.

Suresh Attaluri  27:03  
Okay, so

Swarup Donepudi  27:04  
ultimately, this is a good self service experience, like this is the experience that dev should have, yeah, right. But in 20 as of 2022, this is not the developers experience,

Suresh Attaluri  27:18  
yeah, we are adding more responsibilities to dev developers, yeah, in the Jenkins workflow like,

Swarup Donepudi  27:26  
so this is, again, this is mostly centered around the idea of services like in house built services. In house built Okay, yeah. So they are asking to scale. They are asking to they're being asked to, like, set up, logging, forwarding, all of that. Yeah, I don't think I can put anyway. We established why self service is required in 24 so we'll pause the meeting here, making it a conversation about what is self service, why it is needed. It's just we didn't do anything plant on cloud. So we'll stop here so that I can title the video saying, what is self service DevOps, and then we resume the conversation about, what does it like from building plant on Cloud perspective, how did we we approach providing a good self service experience for developers or on our platform, I think we can directly one, one great way to do that is the console tool itself. This is, this acted as a good guiding reference for me when I was talking about,

Suresh Attaluri  28:37  
yeah, I think in one of our earlier videos we we established this definition of self service. We'll go back and check that one as well the initial videos I was asking you the same questions, what is self service in plant and clouds context? And we will stop this video right now. We'll go back and see that. Okay, I will continue from there. All right. From

there self service on a planet Some Ronnie he discussion,

journey

Suresh Attaluri  29:35  
by ticket. You

Suresh Attaluri  29:59  
the first main space section below, main section videos, series,

initial, first one, two videos, you scenario.

## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f2.self-service-devops.p2.iac-module-script.md
Suresh Attaluri  0:04  
Okay, so welcome back Swarup, this is our second video.

Swarup Donepudi  0:19  
Okay?

Suresh Attaluri  0:28  
You. So this is our second video, first self service DevOps. So in the earlier video, we tried to discuss about the problem of self service. And then I think we digressed a bit to and we went on to went on a discussion of the history of self service, but I don't think that, I mean, we realize that's not what we were trying to achieve here. We the whole agenda to make a video on this feature page is to discuss about self service in plant and clouds context. What is, what do we define, or what do we call which part of plant and Clore that we would like to call as self service divorce, that is what we need to define or determine or put it in that video. Yeah. So earlier we again, we went back to one of our previous recordings where we had a small, short discussion. And there we, I didn't there, we discussed what should be the theme of this video, or what should be this and we the Self Service DevOps part of plant and cloud. So I want to, I will reiterate that part I will and will continue from there. We said in that video we we discussed self service as the ability of providing automation by ops team and the ability of the developers to consume it. So we'll we'll discuss how that ability is provided through plant and cloud at a high level. That is a scope.

Swarup Donepudi  2:35  
Even if you want to introduce a video in which we explain the same concept, we will limit ourselves to not go back into history, but simply say, there is a there is value in creating a centralized platform where platform or DevOps engineers can create the automation, and the platform should make it, make it easy for The platform or DevOps engineers to make that automation available for developers, and the platform should also make it possible for developers to consume that automation. This is the whole idea of creating the platform that that provides self service capabilities without a platform like this. There is no single place where platform there are a lot of problems associated with the whole automation not being able to be like make it easy for developers to consume, etc. So what is self service DevOps? Or what is self service DevOps platform is a platform that makes it easy for ops engineers to create automation, register the automation, and for developers to come to that platform and consume that automation. That's it. Yes, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  3:53  
So, yeah. So the first thing they see is, how do DevOps engineer slash platform engineer can create that automation is the first one. So that should be the part of the script. So how will we show is

Swarup Donepudi  4:14  
and to summarize the gist of the previous conversation, we came up with three different parts of the popular automation categories. One is the IAC modules for provisioning the infrastructure, whether it is compute, network, storage or even being able to creating Kubernetes clusters comes under setting up compute platform for the services to run. So this is all like infrastructure, okay, so for for in this space, the DevOps engineers, or ops engineers will create automation to boots like deploy new services, deploy open source software, or deploy managed services like AWS, RDG.

Suresh Attaluri  5:02  
So this thing comes under provisioning, yeah, provisioning,

Swarup Donepudi  5:04  
or deployments, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  5:08  
So, like we also have these categories like Bootstrap build, in fact, we provision this. Bootstrap

Swarup Donepudi  5:17  
falls under the second category, or maybe we can begin with bootstrapping, but bootstrapping is has not been a very popular requirement. So nice to

Suresh Attaluri  5:29  
have, but build and deploy. I see when we talk in this context, it's not about it's not provisioning. It's building and deploying, isn't it? Provisioning

Swarup Donepudi  5:37  
is also like part of it, okay, so traditionally, when you say deploy, mostly that that just applies to services that developers are building in Build and Deploy. Okay, talk about So build and deploy, right sequence, so you don't build anything of open source or anything like that.

Suresh Attaluri  5:58  
How about having this separate categories, build and deploy and provision, provision will

Swarup Donepudi  6:06  
but build and deploy has entered link. Also, like, you cannot deploy unless build is completed. So there is also a coupling between these two, okay, but the way we build our platform is our deployments. Mean, like, take a bunch of inputs from an infrastructure like IAC module, whether it is pulumi or TerraForm, then we are calling it as the deployment is successful when IAC module exclusion is successful, okay, but in the context of service development, the deploy word itself has a slightly different meaning, yes, sometimes it may involve some shell scripts to copy files to some server if it is, yeah, like, like, for example, lambda, right, build, publish and deploy. These are actually three different steps. So anyway, I want to break down the problem of self service into again, I think that is what we are trying to do to put these automation into different buckets to keep things simple, and it's also probably very easy for people to understand simply that DevOps engineers write IAC automation for the sake of deploying. Again, we will not try and categorize exactly what those IAC modules for fall under will simply say, DevOps engineers right infrastructure as code. We provide a registry, and that makes it available for developers to consume Okay, and senior engineers can create anyone in the organization can create bootstrap cookie cutter templates to bootstrap new services.

Suresh Attaluri  7:42  
Okay, since that is not yet ready, let's talk in this context the deploy, building and deploying or provision. Third

Swarup Donepudi  7:51  
one is for services only, which one

Suresh Attaluri  7:54  
cookie, cookie cutter or templating?

Swarup Donepudi  7:57  
Yeah, CICD templates.

Suresh Attaluri  8:00  
Okay, are we talking about two templates? One is

Swarup Donepudi  8:04  
templates are for only for Bootstrap, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  8:08  
bootstrapping, as in CAC pipeline, or

Swarup Donepudi  8:14  
you want to start, get started with a new Java gRPC service,

Suresh Attaluri  8:19  
and that doesn't include any CAC departments,

Swarup Donepudi  8:23  
yeah, so it's only talks about

Suresh Attaluri  8:27  
because, and what is this, I typically,

Swarup Donepudi  8:29  
if it is an organization, right within an organization, people may create good cookie cutter templates, which includes that also Adding CAC item, because opinionated. We can't do that where the platform provided default templates needs to be separate, because we are trying to support like multiple platforms, whether maybe you want to bootstrap a Java microservice but you want to only deploy it on GitLab, stuff like that, but the cookie cutter templates that engineers within the organization can create. They can include the cacd part also, they may be able to also write a customized folder if they choose to deploy it on plant and cloud, right? So overall, it is extremely difficult to draw clear lines, and trying to put this automation into different categories is very difficult, in my opinion. Okay, so instead, we can simply talk about the type of auto automation, or don't categorize it. Are you going to use it for this purpose? That purpose? No, the categorization that I am trying to give it is IAC modules. Again, don't try to put it in any of these life cycle spans. Don't Bootstrap. Don't do that. If you want to deploy something, there is IAC module resisting. See if you want, if you can use it, okay, and if you want to, we're trying to get started with some service. We are providing, sorry, service cookie cutter templates. That's it. Don't now go dive deeper and say cookie cutter templates will also include CICD to let's not do that problem to solution. Yeah, you want to get started quickly. There are cookie cutter templates. Okay? We

Suresh Attaluri  10:18  
have pulumi registry, yeah, modules which covers the IAC modules.

Swarup Donepudi  10:23  
Yeah, we have IAC registry. It's coming soon. That's why I'm like saying I'm starting to

Suresh Attaluri  10:31  
call it as is, so IAC registry, and let's talk about IAC registry, and how can we demo it through that video? What can we show on a video, right on overall

Swarup Donepudi  10:48  
summarizing in the context of quantum cloud, self service goops And we also concluded our discussion saying, What is a self service platform, and because we are calling it as self service platform, essentially something that dev ops and devs can collaborate. So these people come here to supply, and these people come here to consume, and what is being supplied here is IAC modules, cookie cutter templates, cutter templates, and then CI, CD templates. Okay. Now what? Where do this fall at a high level? No clear boundaries can be defined at a very high level. Devs, when they want to bootstrap new services, they rely on cookie cutters. Devs, when they try to add CICD for both build setting up build automation and deployment automation, they rely on CICD templates. The details at this point are very difficult to work and devs when they want to deploy open source software or cloud infrastructure or

Suresh Attaluri  12:09  
service, what, or services?

Swarup Donepudi  12:14  
That's what we don't want to do that in IAC, yeah, don't talk about services in IAC, okay, that that kind of case.

Suresh Attaluri  12:22  
So that's what CICD is involved. That's what you're saying. Yeah. Again,

Swarup Donepudi  12:26  
what I'm trying to say is, from a sales perspective, you don't have to clearly. So even though, in our own design services are being deployed here, the world doesn't know. So we'll limit this guy to simply say, you can deploy open source, you can deploy cloud infrastructure, okay, I see your point. Or you can deploy services, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  12:57  
as long as I get your partner that here, when we are demoing it, we show that we have this ability to provision. Yeah, you can still do the services thing and all, but that's how we want to tell that story of ISC modules, right? Yeah, yeah. When we you, we have that registry also, right now, there's the other we are not highlighting. We had a discussion earlier, like in in our ISC modules registry, which we have right now, we're not highlighting the service side of the category, and we were discussing about highlighting that.

Swarup Donepudi  13:37  
Yeah. So, yeah, we need to, yeah. All I'm trying to say is it's very easy for someone to understand what these modules, how these can be used for OSs and cloud infrastructure or manage, but when you say services, right? Yeah, that's mixing it up with other stuff. So I'm saying, let's not talk about services at all. Understand that, oh, you're saying CIC templates. Then I'm assuming that continuous deployment will ensure my services get deployed. Yes, the devil is in the details, which is we are in our framework. We use IAC modules behind the scenes to do the deployment itself. But, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  14:21  
got it cool. So let's write down the steps or script how an IAC module will be demoed. Okay, we'll go to plant and clouds platform. How about creating will start from that point where we will create a module on IAC module registry, a custom defined ISC module registry. Okay, so user one will log in as user one. I mean having that personas of platform engineering and developer, user two would be developer and platform engineer will log in assuming that there is already a pulumi mod, pulumi slash TerraForm module already available in GitHub. Using that platform, engineer will, will just quickly go through the module what it is. We'll talk about it using that GitHub link. Will will register that module onto plant and cloud in our registry, okay? And then we'll switch to the other user. We'll see that the newly created module is available for user with all with all the details. And then, the other side, developer will, will, will try to use that module and create this thing

Swarup Donepudi  16:13  
that them, demoing all of that is necessary like, rather than like, showing it

Suresh Attaluri  16:20  
instead of creating we'll just show, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:22  
I'm just thinking out loud as to if long it takes and stuff, yeah, we can edit things away. Like, all the waiting time can be removed, even from the product standpoint. You need to make test it, but streaming helps us, like, cover all the missing elements. I think we can. We can try that actually.

Suresh Attaluri  16:48  
And once this is done, at the end, we can show that there are so many other modules, default modules, that user will already get. And also, there are different, yeah, the number of the volume thing can also be the mode, right? Like there are these, these many

Swarup Donepudi  17:12  
deployment modules that are readily available, yeah, so overall, the structure, so are we talking about three different videos? Just click on, yes. Like Kubernetes dashboard we talked about, like the

Suresh Attaluri  17:28  
one we just discussed. I'm thinking that is for ISC modules. Okay, so there will be three modules here for cookie cutter and Cid, CD, templates as well.

Swarup Donepudi  17:41  
And right now we don't have those ready, the cookie

Suresh Attaluri  17:46  
cutter one and CAC will include them.

Swarup Donepudi  17:52  
Okay, so here there will be a three tab videos. Video, yeah, first video, we will show IAC modules, how they help? Self Service, yes, DevOps, developer, DevOps, engineer, register module and developer consumes. But developer, if you want to deploy something for which the DevOps hasn't customized, then developer will still be able to deploy with the readiness, available automation. And that's it, we'll conclude that. So what kind of IAC module can we have the DevOps engineer customize? Maybe Redis is good,

Suresh Attaluri  18:35  
Redis or some AWS.

Swarup Donepudi  18:41  
We'll keep them to cloudinfra. So yeah, I think DynamoDB table is a good example, saying the company, or maybe Sri bucket is a good example. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  18:57  
I think, oh, yeah, the feature that we need to highlight is that how easily a GitHub project has been imported into our registry. Nothing, right. They just need to give the URL and

Swarup Donepudi  19:20  
the commit ID committee is also

Suresh Attaluri  19:23  
optional, but we can mention and then, yeah, we have this ability of by giving, because that's the when we talk about self service, that is, that's what we want to set up,

Swarup Donepudi  19:41  
the component for which you are trying to do and provide a description the clone URL branch. And all of these are mostly optional, and if it is pulling your project,

Suresh Attaluri  19:57  
okay, I think few other things will come up for TerraForm, I will believe, and also that commit SHA, is it possible we take a tag and then

Swarup Donepudi  20:12  
I need to test okay,

Suresh Attaluri  20:14  
just, I mean, just want to call out the it's okay, but I haven't

Swarup Donepudi  20:21  
tested it yet. So

Suresh Attaluri  20:25  
okay. So yeah, this is what we need to do. Okay, and again, all demos. The first thing that comes is plantora. Do you think we need to add this option of adding a pulumi module to plantora, because

Swarup Donepudi  20:44  
demo, frequent action, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  20:48  
as a demo, friend and we going, since we are going out to market as a AI, first platform for me

Swarup Donepudi  21:00  
being the sales guy, if I can get as much as in plantora, I'll be happy. Okay, yeah, that would be my first preference, because we agreed that plantora is the most easiest way to show things, rather than jumping around UIs and UX. That confuses people. So yeah, but it depends on, like, the complexity, how I don't know, practicality. So yeah, make me you can keep making notes. You know what we are going to demonstrate. So depending on, like, what's possible, you keep making the notes. And,

Suresh Attaluri  21:39  
yeah,

so morning, we added creators dashboard thing also to chat. Similarly, if we get this option ready, we can demo it from the chart itself, where user entering. I think

Swarup Donepudi  22:08  
I may have to also make a note for my own self, which is, you need to start doing more engineering falling behind all of these, which is, right now, the stack job config, which can be defined at all, env level, right, right now this one doesn't have a deployment depth, comp to Module map, meaning if, for example, switches the organization and they defined a custom module for deploying s3 buckets, and the platform engineer wants to make this s3 bucket as the default SD bucket for all s3 buckets deployed in swiggy all the SJC config doesn't have this map right now. It's easy to add. I need to make it so like you add a pulumi module for chat, but then configuring that pulumi module to be the default module for all s3 buckets is not something that's available right now. However, what is possible now is at resource level. So there are three levels where SDSC can be defined, okay, so at SJC level, resource level, we do so, but that needs to be defined by default. You don't have nobody has to define SJC resource level

Suresh Attaluri  23:33  
while creating you won't be able to by creating a resource, yeah, you won't be able to choose SJC Yeah, stack joke, yeah, that because

Swarup Donepudi  23:43  
we exactly need standalone API resource all by itself. So you first have to Yeah, these are

Suresh Attaluri  23:54  
for like university bucket Coronavirus module is available, and if someone wants to create it, they can't

Swarup Donepudi  24:05  
use the track, again, again. Use cases can be any but the practical use case is not, I don't think that is. Nobody even asked, asking for it. Yeah, it won't be a problem in practical work. It's not like, oh, I have created the module I want people to you can definitely skip API, like running the Stackdriver itself. Like, what's the worst that can happen? The MSD bucket gets created based on your org or env level, right? And then you come back and you operate, and you rerun your stagnant, yeah, when we talk

Suresh Attaluri  24:45  
about organization, yeah. Do you think people will create multiple modules for one particular resource, versions of module? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:59  
but for in our design model, I can't think of a way to support multiple at any point. It can only be one. But is it in a real life scenario? Yeah, I haven't seen that practically either. People are they washing it meaning, and they handle utils conditions and stuff like that. But one module for deploying s3 that itself is a lot of work in organization. So maintaining multiple is like next level expectation. Nobody supports it. Even having one well defined module per the popular components itself is rarely seen the it's not as streamlined, contrary to expectation, it's all over the place, in many places. So yeah, so summarizing that is a while. This is an action item for you, for me, adding a deployment component module map to organization and environment level is, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  26:01  
see, the reason I'm saying that we will add it to the chart is to make our demos more, yeah, reachable or more, as I said, easy to understand.

Swarup Donepudi  26:13  
I will never say no to anything that get that is getting added to chat. Yeah. You want to make that as powerful as possible at the same time,

Suresh Attaluri  26:23  
there are certain locations, complexity

Swarup Donepudi  26:24  
makes me ask for more, but depending on your like bandwidth and the ability to or the complexity involved, you can make the judgment you deploy. And so yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  26:37  
we'll give the intent through form or through the chat, and that will create, register the module, register the module, and we'll open another chart for user two, or a form like earlier. That's what we discussed, is that the developer has to use that module which got registered. So other, another chart will make another, this thing request of deploying.

Swarup Donepudi  27:08  
So I think for for configuring stack job, this is where they'll have to edit so right now they are able to configure credentials at organization level, but I need to report this to Satish. I

Suresh Attaluri  27:51  
How do you know that is a Create Form,

Swarup Donepudi  27:54  
a create standard? Oh, I should have

Unknown Speaker  27:56  
done like this.

Swarup Donepudi  28:04  
Yeah, so this is where it should be. So you know, the second step would be to come here and add it as the default one. So if you want to do it via chat, then we need to add an agent for that too, like updating stack, job config,

Suresh Attaluri  28:19  
okay, yeah, we can do that, right? I see this handling stack, job, configs itself is a separate tedious task for someone, right? So it's our own abstraction. Our own abstraction.

Swarup Donepudi  28:36  
Yeah, I would say there is value in putting this into chat.

Suresh Attaluri  28:40  
Creates, tag, jobs, config, keep making notes.

Swarup Donepudi  28:43  
Let's see how far you can go. Yeah, I

start. I'm starting to see the gaps in the product when we're talking about demos, like,

Suresh Attaluri  28:58  
yes, yes, not.

Swarup Donepudi  29:04  
Such big deal. But yeah, smoothing edges. Okay, so

Suresh Attaluri  29:09  
yeah, so we'll have these options on chat so there are platform engineer sent will clearly show resting a pulumi module and setting that as to environment. Now the developer will log in, they put some intent of deploying something, and that will get deployed. But how will we show that the same stack, job, config, has been used by the devil in the while deploying the resource, I mean, whatever you, the developer, has requested, then we need to go back and open that stack, job, resource, Details page, and open the stack config, right thing, right? We can still do that. Yeah. Or you can even add intent to get stack job config for API resource,

Swarup Donepudi  30:17  
Yeah, but how about

Suresh Attaluri  30:18  
this thing? I uh, user, I I always try to do this deployment right? I'm clueless which stack job config is being used. How about we add intent of, if I give an environment, I'll get the stack job config of it,

Swarup Donepudi  30:41  
okay, any, give you any resource you want a stack job config back,

Suresh Attaluri  30:45  
yeah, any resource, if it is created, but if I'm about to create a resource as well, I would like to know, right,

Swarup Donepudi  30:52  
yeah, any resource as an environment is a resource in the context of stack job config, organization is the resource ID as input, yeah? So I think that will be an RPC first. So I need to add RPC hierarchically.

Suresh Attaluri  31:14  
I think we should try for the chart demo only. Okay. There are so many things like, like Stackdriver, configs, pulumi module registry, GitHub is involved here and another users perspective, there are two personas from engineering and developers. So as a demo standpoint, it would be better if we have less number of screens to switch, to tell nice nice to tell a nice story, agreed. And also we need to show the pulumi registry, the registry page where the user can search. And

Swarup Donepudi  32:01  
I'm thinking one other, another way for us to show that is that logs itself, like the stack job blocks that we are showing, right, that can show information about the module that is being used, always

Suresh Attaluri  32:19  
stack job logs, yeah. So what do you mean by stack job? So when,

Swarup Donepudi  32:23  
when a stack job gets executed, we are showing this in this one only, right, okay, so here we can show that information as a first step.

Suresh Attaluri  32:37  
Okay, how will, how will we show that? Do we have it? It will have any name you need to show the module. We are

Swarup Donepudi  32:44  
fully in control of what is being displayed here, right? So we can, I can include that data in the snapshot as a separate object, like, for example, okay, this is a pulumi Refresh operation object which contains summary map and this. So these are all three type objects. It should be put you have one other object type. It's not a stack job progress. It is stack job info or something module info, where within this stack job you will have that info, and that will be displayed maybe in a separate section.

Suresh Attaluri  33:19  
How about putting it here, like in pulumi registry. Just, we thought it's okay, yeah, if

Swarup Donepudi  33:24  
it is being displayed on this page, it can go here. Or if it is being displayed in the chat, chat, also, we are triggering, right, okay. So if you want the same interface, then we put we can put here, and it will be the same

Suresh Attaluri  33:39  
thing. Chat, also, okay, okay, or we can add a section. Oh, somehow, yeah, we'll see the

Swarup Donepudi  33:47  
instead of making it a separate thing. I think this is a good place, right? When you look up the stack job details, it should tell you all the story. What

Suresh Attaluri  33:57  
is the module, what

Swarup Donepudi  33:58  
was used, and what are the credential IDs used? Etc, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  34:03  
But getting a stack job config by resource ID is still relevant, I believe, meaning you on the on the chart, someone, I mean, the reason that we proposing that option is to check this module that is going to be used before the job is being

Swarup Donepudi  34:26  
skeptical and critical, don't get me wrong, which is, we don't want to create our own requirements. Okay, same thing, like, I know these are all functions that will make a nice user experience. I want to hear justification of like, what's the problem that it may solve, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  34:44  
The reason, when I propose this is to is for the demo. But we said, how will but

Swarup Donepudi  34:53  
we know in the demo that it will work right

Suresh Attaluri  34:56  
now, now, after adding it on the stack job page. No,

Swarup Donepudi  35:00  
it's not about showing the user whether what what was used, but we know that it will work, which is, you register a module, you update organization stack, job config to use this module as the default one. Okay, now the next challenge is how to show that information to the user?

Suresh Attaluri  35:20  
Yeah, that's where we will improvise the

Swarup Donepudi  35:23  
stack job information to include that info as well. Yeah, but that additional RPC to get that hierarchical like resolution of stack job config, given an RPC, or given a resource ID or whatever, okay, that is what I was questioning, like, Will users even have a use case to ask them?

Suresh Attaluri  35:46  
No, the only use case is demo, and you're saying that we'll put it on Stackdriver.

Swarup Donepudi  35:50  
But I think regardless of the demo, that information is useful here for sure, showing which module executed this right now, there is no idea, right? You can tell, you can tell, by this guy, but that also should, doesn't. We will not show you the get to repo information, etc, like plankton get

so in the stack job itself, you will be able to see which module was used, but that's just modulate. Then you will have to do that again. So this is where you get the web URL, yeah, we can

Suresh Attaluri  36:41  
do that, right? So, you mean, like, what we are doing with Version History we call a separate RPC, I think somewhere, somewhat,

Swarup Donepudi  36:57  
Oh, you mean to display that information here? Yes, okay, instead of persisting in Stackdriver,

Suresh Attaluri  37:05  
the ideal is the right way to do it,

Swarup Donepudi  37:08  
yeah, I think so. Instead of really making any changes, it's a UX change, and Satish will update to display this information, which includes, okay, yeah, saving

Suresh Attaluri  37:22  
the URLs is not a right way to do right can be changed.

Swarup Donepudi  37:28  
That's, that's the important part, which stack job, and somebody upgraded pooling module URL, again, a requirement that I'm creating. So persisting the URL for the repo for which the stack job ran at that point in time is more relevant. And I think that that was the reason why we were actually persisting these also. These can also be derived at runtime, but we were taking trying to take a snapshot of what was used at that point. But yeah, for now, we can ask Satish to simply update. This will first get your shot online, update this info. Same thing will be shown even in the chat, saying info, and that is derived from lookup the ID, make a call, get the info, display that info,

Suresh Attaluri  38:25  
okay, yeah, I think that's it. Calls for the video script, right?

Swarup Donepudi  38:30  
Yeah, the IAC module. Okay, I'm wrapping it up just for The title. I Okay, this one.

Suresh Attaluri  38:55  
Just so together, what

Swarup Donepudi  39:09  
is self service and a doctor?

Oh,

Suresh Attaluri  39:38  
can they sections easier? I To lacuna believe video script, or most of the discussion, IP address.

## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f2.self-service-devops.p3.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:05  
Okay, I think I don't know if the page is actually structured according to this discussion we have. So the hero section, and then we are, this is the problem statement section,

Suresh Attaluri  0:22  
so,

Swarup Donepudi  0:26  
and we talked about having a video right for problem statement, and I think I have a script. I'm going to tell you the script and tell me if, if you're, like, happy with it. Basically, I explained, I think chatgpt came up with this based on my that explanation, I will be I did this with both Sana and de rich. Basically, orgs will have different maturity levels, providing self service to developers. The first level of maturity is no automation. The best self service they can offer is ticket, ops, meaning dev puts in a ticket for whatever he wants. Ops will do that, okay? And second one is like partial self service. Partial self service, where ops will create modules and put them on GitHub and create documentation. Devs can self service offline, but by learning documentation and stuff like that. Third one is click ops, which is where IDPs. So today these, this is more. This is like becoming the standard click, ops, devs, ops, register, devs come click. The fourth one we are doing is kind of chat ops, same register, but instead of clicking, devs do chat up, so self service DevOps is if you don't have either clickups or ChatOps, if you have this, then people are waiting. Either people are waiting or people are learning. So this is what I'm going to explain in the video. But

Suresh Attaluri  2:15  
how will you demonstrate that? Like ticket ops?

Swarup Donepudi  2:20  
I'm not a concepts, more demos, no

Suresh Attaluri  2:25  
screen will just talk and either

Swarup Donepudi  2:27  
whiteboard or iPad drawing saying same exact

Suresh Attaluri  2:31  
that iPad drawing is nice. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  2:34  
nicer interface for from quality perspective, this is it, and I have,

Suresh Attaluri  2:40  
I think most of those problems can be shown through that iPad recordings,

Swarup Donepudi  2:48  
yeah, yeah, even that's what I thought. But I think problem statements, we agreed that those will be videos, because we need to explain the concept. So this is the story for self service, DevOps, yes, these are the problems, and in this space, developers are waiting. They're spending lot of time getting blocked due risk. So a high cost of waiting, traditional ticket based systems slowed on progress and frustrated team every minute spent waiting on a process, not spending

Suresh Attaluri  3:18  
innovating substitutes, transforming weeks of waiting into instant action.

Swarup Donepudi  3:22  
Yeah, then here there will be a room video with me in iPad explaining same concept organizations at different maturity levels with plan, if organization can provide, like, high quality, oh, this is just problem space. That's it. So providing an internal developer platform for developers to enable self service is a good solution. That's it. We'll end the meeting there. Say goodbye to delays and dependencies. So this is where I think it begins unleash the power of self service. Say goodbye to delays

Suresh Attaluri  3:59  
for all other. I don't know if you have any pattern, but we are showing those sections of ISC. Like here, we decided there are three categories, yeah, IC modules, cookie cutter and CICD templates, yeah, those should be sections, sections, right? I'll

Swarup Donepudi  4:19  
redo this page.

Suresh Attaluri  4:22  
I think it's okay to have smaller pages rather than, I think at this point we can incrementally, always add things, more sections to it. But let's do that organically, that when something comes up, then we can add it rather than, I think,

Swarup Donepudi  4:39  
self service, DevOps. Fourth part will be operations.

Operations will simply talk about, do we have the Kubernetes dashboard? Right? We will not again. Will incrementally add, if we feel it right, right now, you're right. Don't want to get too greedy and make this very, extremely difficult for us. You want to keep these pages simple and at least get get past the definition of

Suresh Attaluri  5:12  
dumpling. So right now, I only see one section coming up over there. Yeah. ISC modules, yeah. But, and we'll, we'll add a screenshot of those module templates, templates

Swarup Donepudi  5:30  
the high cost of waiting, okay, and maybe unleash the power of self service platform. Maybe, maybe here this section can stay, and we'll have screenshots of,

Suresh Attaluri  5:47  
how about this? Unleash the power of self service DevOps. Okay, like here you said about arcs, this ticket ops and partial self service thing, right? That's the problem part of here we can put another video and explain how click ops and chart ops bring difference. Okay, yeah, still no platform being shown. But

and next would be this IAC module section, okay, where we can show we can add this point of we can add a screenshot of our platform with those rich modules, existing modules

Swarup Donepudi  6:43  
at to redo this page. I think we're the reason why we are having difficulty is we are not talking about a specific section titled in a certain way. So but for me, the action item would be to redo this page by only adding sections around the Self Service DevOps around, I think AC modules, cookie cutter template, CAC templates. When

Suresh Attaluri  7:06  
this was made, there was not be a clear definition of self service DevOps. And I believe the other video which you saw, yeah, I

Swarup Donepudi  7:15  
think I asked chatgpt, I'm going to tell you all about the product, you can tell me, or you can create sections from self service doors, because, again, there was no clear definition there. So I'll redo this page only with minimal sections, IAC modules, cookie cutter templates and CAC templates. And for each of them, we'll just put screenshots of the pulumi registry and deployment component screenshots. IAC cookie cutter template, screenshots, GitHub actions and get

Suresh Attaluri  7:44  
a workflow screenshot. We have those

Swarup Donepudi  7:48  
history, and we'll just line, write one or two liners, no videos, nothing. Will close the page, and I'll remove everything else that is not relevant. And at the end, I'll simply say, Yeah, this is like lot of unneeded stuff on this page. Yeah, is not very well done. So okay, cool. Did we didn't talk about the videos for particular templates, and this because we don't have them working yet, yeah? So we will not add it. Yes, we'll do the only add one video where we are only showing the IAC modules. Part. Will not add even the tiles for tabs for these. We'll add it when we have it.

Suresh Attaluri  8:33  
Or we can add and just say, coming soon.

Swarup Donepudi  8:35  
Yeah, we can do that

Suresh Attaluri  8:38  
list as a placeholders. Or

Swarup Donepudi  8:40  
maybe I can record a video where I can simply show, here is the service of here is the CICD template library. Here the action CICD templates can be registered. And we are working on adding, adding the ability to configure your service repositories to add these, yes, and here is the list of cookie cutter templates available. And if the work is completed by the time we record the video, we'll say it's this is how you do it. If not, this is coming soon, yeah. And then the page will have three small sections, one talking about IAC modules and one talking about cookie cutter one talking about CACT templates. I'll do console app tour when all of this is implemented, and then come up with the page sections once again. Then, okay, that concludes the Self Service media discussions. I

Suresh Attaluri  10:17  
i demos you immediate.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f3.service-hub.md
Unknown Speaker  0:10  
Oh, do you Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  0:12  
hello, welcome back. Swarup, so in our series of videos that we are making, we reached service hub, and there is a first video to discuss service hub as a feature and the media content that we are going to put on the service hub feature, feature page. Can you open the figma design, the current figma design, so this is the current figma design. The title says, streamline your micro service development with service hub. That's what is the title so, and the subtitle section is centralized, accelerate, simplify service creation with plant and cloud as enabled. So as a service hub, we have a on platform. We have the service hub, kind of market, marketplace, where, where.

Swarup Donepudi  1:22  
So this is not a marketplace, a service hub on our UX design, okay, is like an explorer, where, explorer of what? This one all your services, gaining complete visibility into every micro service within your organization. Service of provides a centralized facility where you can explore the Manage and understand all your services onboard the developer, supportlessly by game. So this is one difference between self service DevOps and service of the catalog itself.

Suresh Attaluri  1:55  
So this is not marketplace. I was thinking service hub is marketplace of CICD templates. That's what my

Swarup Donepudi  2:03  
source code template.

Unknown Speaker  2:06  
Okay, okay,

Swarup Donepudi  2:09  
there is a connection between these two. But service hub is more about

Suresh Attaluri  2:15  
what all the services, and it helps

Swarup Donepudi  2:17  
you onboard new developers quickly by instantly providing them access to all the information about the services. Who owns it, what is the language that is it is created, which environments it is deployed to, okay. Service discovery is a big problem, and internal developer portals one of the core capabilities that is expected, along with self service, self service being action oriented, service of being information present, like explorer, okay? And in future, the service hub will slowly start extending into a more of information, only, not actions. Which is like, what is the health of the service? Where are the monitors located? Where is the how can I access the logs for this on, say, my logging aggregator? So those will start to become kind of plugins. And so servicerp is definitely a big part of the internal developer platforms. There is no clear definition on like what it entails. But again, we both agreed that devs do 80% of the spend 80% of their time developing services. Yeah, so if you think about the rest of the entire platform, it only takes care of that 20% okay, like they want databases. They own this. They own that, blah, blah, blah, but they spend time in like, bootstrapping new services, which we talked about from, like the template library, they do that, and then they iterate, which is they want to set up CAC, and then they deploy, and then they want to monitor logs. All those aspects of service hub becomes like the central point and beyond.

Suresh Attaluri  3:54  
I hear what you say, but still I have my doubts. I don't have a clear picture about service hub. That's what I can say. And I believe we we had this discussion of designing service hub as well defining what a service is on plant and cloud and all. How about we show what is there right now on the platform when we talk about service, or any one example that we can take and go through that? So, so the

Swarup Donepudi  4:32  
design has a good example. These were taken from the design itself. So in our micro services, like, if you go back to the canvas, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  4:46  
no, no, let's take this example, right? I got, I saw one service called being billing API. Like, if in an organization, some team wants to Bill API back end service, what would be the journey in the context of plant and cloud? So building API back end service, they would then it is a new service that they need to build. So new services begin

Swarup Donepudi  5:19  
with bootstrapping, bootstrapping, but that's optional, also assuming they use leverage all the features that platform provides. It begins with bootstrapping using one of the template from this template library

Suresh Attaluri  5:32  
we are calling without plant and cloud. I see me going and creating a GitHub repository, yeah, but that is bootstrap plant and cloud. Also you can bootstrap pass.

Swarup Donepudi  5:42  
No, no,

Suresh Attaluri  5:44  
okay, okay, so would assume that I have already bootstrapped now, how will a user bring that service on to this service hub or and how will the other journey will be, what benefit that they're going to get? I mean, they can still have that project on GitHub, and they can do, they can do all those things, right, CICD and all. But how, how plant and cloud is bringing the difference in their workflow? Can we discuss Git

Swarup Donepudi  6:18  
repositories of everything? So it's not possible, or GitHub is not built to present your internal organization services, okay, oriented towards presenting the all Git repositories, there is a difference between a git repository and a service, okay. Now, what's the experience with planton Cloud is okay. You bootstrap your service on GitHub. Nobody knows about it. Now you want to add CICD configuration to it, yes, and you can still do that without help of plant on Cloud, yes, go into the repository. You can probably add just like the way we do, you copy the Customize files from somewhere. You copy the GitHub dot action files from another repository. That is what most people do anyway, and you're deploying the service. Now, the way planta code currently is designed to like work is assuming that they also use plankton cloud provided actions to deploy to either Kubernetes or fargate or any deployment targets that we identify the service and resist automatically register it as create a service definition. Okay, that is what I mean by register, what will happen is, during the registration process, there is a some information captured, like, which what was the identity used to deploy that particular service onto, say, micro like Kubernetes cluster. Okay, so that identity becomes the owner of the service, and where was the repository in which it got deployed from?

Suresh Attaluri  8:05  
Like, can we take a real time example, like auth service or billing API? I have a it is bootstrapped. Now it got created here. So what will the information be? I mean, do we have the profile ready for this? It's not fully built, but yeah, whatever is there, and then we can incrementally discuss, right? What are the other things are going to be added?

Swarup Donepudi  8:40  
Okay, so this is a manually added but

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
I think so it has this information, programming language and envy. I mean, at a high level, I can say the programming language and the environments the service get can get deployed, right that's the basic information that we are capturing right now, but we can extend it to so many other things we

Swarup Donepudi  9:11  
talked about, lots of extension points, which is capturing the build jobs that ran, providing a list here, If the build is running, provide a real time progress for that build, etc, etc, but we do follow up on that, yeah. So,

Suresh Attaluri  9:31  
yeah, I see your point. Like people expect service to know that on which environments the service got deployed, and what is the commit that got deployed, and all such information. Right now we have micro service instances, but,

Swarup Donepudi  9:49  
but that is not more from an ISU oriented person perspective. What is the configuration that is needed to deploy something on to what platform, platform, but that that specification is not to define service, yes, just one infrastructure component. So we are extracting some of the information from that specification and then building that service definition as a construct. So if billing is the name of the repository, and if the repository ran like, we'd have action executed and the service got deployed to Kubernetes. We take billing as the name of the service, because the repository name is billing, yeah. And we can probably provide a way for users to, like, do some different mapping. I don't know how, but, and if the service gets deployed to another environment, we add those environments to this parent definition, yeah, and in the design, if the user is here, if he clicks on. So right now, this has been pulled from search. So we are not update. We are not doing such indexing for the environment deployment map. That's why we're not displaying it here, if not, if the user clicks on this, we provide which environments it is deployed to and what so

Suresh Attaluri  11:18  
the purpose of service hub is to manage services. Right now the ability, as part of managing we have the ability to add environments to a service so that they can be deployed to multiple environments. And

Swarup Donepudi  11:34  
it is odd. It's the reverse. You can deploy to any environment that you have access to, deploying any resource. Yeah, we are capturing the information, yeah. Now this is not like the author, but

Suresh Attaluri  11:47  
like, we are not giving the option to deploy or undeploy a service onto an environment I was expecting that to be found in service of Isn't it

Swarup Donepudi  12:00  
like this cannot be deployed to something.

Suresh Attaluri  12:06  
Let's say one service is deployed on to dev and prod environments. Now I want to undeploy, or remove the deployment from dev environment. Can I do that? Can I do that operation from service, yeah. I mean, I mean, are we thinking of doing that kind of an experience is

Swarup Donepudi  12:28  
absolutely part of so when

Suresh Attaluri  12:30  
I say managing services, what do we do as part of managing I am seeing and deploying and undeploying as one of the task. We can add more things to it. And

Swarup Donepudi  12:45  
so information retrieval is surfacing in one aspect,

Suresh Attaluri  12:48  
one aspect of it, and which programming language, who is the owner of this service, so that if certain credentials, or if a developer, a newly onboarded developer to the team wants to set up a service on his local machine, they would need certain information, like which programming language, or they can still look at the readme file and all but or whom to reach out to, like the owner of the service so that setup can be done locally. So that's one thing that I'm looking I

Swarup Donepudi  13:26  
feel like I want to scope out the product in such a way. So far, we have had success in building the product based on our own requirements. I think most of the product evolved from that perspective, yeah, which is, why did we add Redis? Why did we add a success? Why did we have even add micro service to the deployment component? It's all driven by our own requirements. Mostly, yes, the rest of the components which are not fully implemented, all of that is to expand that concept and to make it more presentable and help others get the context. When it comes to service hub, I want to do the same exact thing. Why do we not have Why did we not have service hub in the first place? While we were we have already been developing services because we took it easy, meaning we were not using our own platform to take care of like, bootstrapping. We never used our platform to bootstrap. We never used our platform to configure CICD. We are doing it from like local. So we are avoiding those problems altogether, and that is the reason why we don't have that like, how many services do we have? We are going and exploring, like the micro service Kubernetes as a alternative to it. Why that should have been this place? Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  14:50  
so do you think exploring has that much of value? I'm not like just knowing the information that in a in my or in an organization, that these are the services that we have to just list those services.

Swarup Donepudi  15:09  
There is more profile to every service.

Suresh Attaluri  15:11  
Okay, which programming language, if

Swarup Donepudi  15:14  
you see the full feature set, some of the features don't are not really useful for one, one man startup, like, for example, Washington and historical jobs, right? He knows everything. And similarly, some of the features are not applicable for like, 10 member organization, because there is very few services. Everybody knows about those. So any information that is captured now go beyond and do a 50 member company, that's when people start asking, Hey, who owns the service? Who owns that service? Yeah, okay, so that, in fact, that is the reason why we didn't do much of service, because these problems are not as significant for one man startup or 10 episode, but it is expected to be a good component within internal developer platform. So I am mostly calling out the requirements from what is expected in an internal developer platform versus what we know today. Okay, because we don't know much, like even in your experience, right? You didn't spend much time dealing with any services you always I gave you, like make release you, even I did that, I created the wrong practice, I guess. But we wanted to move fast, and that is what most young startups do. They want to move fast. They want to just follow. So maybe if we start to become more disciplined and take service up seriously for the purpose of the product itself, because we are like selling the product and is expected. So if we start taking we will starting now. Will not push a commit, and if you push a commit, it has to be deployed by gate of actions from the drawer, we will remove, like access for all of us, direct Kubernetes cluster access should be removed, but see,

Suresh Attaluri  17:02  
that's a gap. I mean, lack of consider it as my ignorance when you say we'll push micro service through GitHub actions. How is that related to this service hub on plant and cloud platform. I mean, if we, even if we make that practice of GitHub, I mean deploying services through GitHub actions. How is it connected to the service hub that we service a feature that we have on plant and cloud? How are these two things? Those are CICD pipelines, right? That's how I'm that runner on GitHub, runners, I'm not able to understand how these two parts are connected. What's my question? Or

Swarup Donepudi  18:01  
yeah, thinking how to answer that. So you're, you're, you're unable to connect the dots between the concept of a service definition on service hub and a Git git repository, or a repository on GitHub which has a cacd automation setup, and that

Suresh Attaluri  18:24  
goes, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  18:27  
So how do the what is the link between these two? These two? Yes, yeah. So when I was in CDK and there were, there were a lot of services, obviously, because they're like typical, right? Yes. And there was one seven requirement from the organization saying, I need, we need a list of all the services that are being developed and how much of the resources that they are consuming. Pull up a report, okay, we want to attribute the cost of the infrastructure like, there is x, x dollars for AWS bill. Like, what the fuck is going on? And what is CDK? CDK is a software company, okay, what is the AWS used for, obviously, to provide some APIs can consume. Okay, so all of these are services. These services use data layer, some databases, so those are also deployed on AWS. I want everything to be attributed. We want a report. Report,

Suresh Attaluri  19:37  
how much is the resource services are consuming, and what the rest of the other Yeah, in

Swarup Donepudi  19:45  
both cases, zero and CDK, it didn't happen, okay. There was an initiative that began saying, Can you being an ops team or a DevOps team? Okay, can you put together a system in which we can see in real time which teams own what and where this they get deployed. What can we like have that bread crumbs? Okay, everything existed on BitBucket. Everything existed on AWS, okay, this, you can mix and match the names. Maybe you can identify that, oh, the name of the repository is named this way. Looks like this may be on like associated with that GitHub. Okay, the information is not present. You will have to go around and like, connect the dots all yourself. Okay, so what is the value of capturing information, and what is the relationship between GitHub and this information is GitHub is, is where the services are born and live during their life cycle. They get updated all the time because that's where the code lives, right? But it's common that where you name the repository in micro services world of what you're trying to use it for, okay? So it exists on GitHub, but on the day when that question was asked, nobody knew a way to get

Suresh Attaluri  21:07  
i and I'm not questioning that part of service, like earlier, also, I asked, Does listing of services have any value? You said, yes, they will. They have some value and information, information, view, view or information. You know that a particular GitHub repository is a service. We definitely have a value. But my question comes to this point, like when you said, we should make a practice of having GitHub actions for every service that we are going to deploy. Okay, assuming that we started that practice. What difference that I mean doing that practice of having GitHub actions? What difference that it is going to bring to service hub as a feature on plant and cloud, okay, so for that,

Swarup Donepudi  22:11  
I meant that so far in plant and cloud data modeling, domain modeling, we did not design the domain to accommodate those aspects of service development because we were kind of bypassing the system which

Suresh Attaluri  22:35  
which Parts of service development, adding a, adding a CS

Swarup Donepudi  22:40  
in collaboration Swarup, running make these prod is uncommon,

Suresh Attaluri  22:46  
so that CI, CD thing, GitHub, creating GitHub actions, build and deploy is something that we are doing manually from our local machines. Add any add any actions. But the difference that we are going to bring to the our platform or service hub as a feature is will add this ability to each service or option of creating those build and deployments is, I am not

Swarup Donepudi  23:18  
concretely explaining you what would happen. Okay, we start not bypassing these. We start actually making sure we do all those things with the help of plantain cloud. I don't know what the end result of plankton cloud is going to look like. However, I'm saying, if we stop doing those bypass operations, you will now focus on the domain model aspect like, yeah, those are necessary, okay, all of those things will will align with service of eventually, as to what exactly those are, I can defend right now.

Suresh Attaluri  23:59  
Yes, yes. Okay, yeah, that requires a long design discussions and all. I'm not talking about the domain discussion, but me, with all my ignorance, assuming that, like right now, you have a view right if, can I assume that I will have an option or a button here saying, build this project. Is it reasonable for me to assume that each service in service hub will have that option of building build triggers? Build triggers from IDPs. Oh, it is not even expected from, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:45  
even that is the reason like we because we are not forcing ourselves to learn the best practices. Okay, best practices, if we do, then the very basic expectation is builds are triggered by commit,

Suresh Attaluri  25:01  
pushes, yeah, sorry, not not triggering builds. How about adding a button, adding, giving an option, saying, add GitHub actions for me or GitLab pipelines for me to build this project. Is that a reasonable expectation from user? I think so. Yeah. And similarly, add deploy, okay, add deploy action for me on to this environment. Also,

Swarup Donepudi  25:44  
I can imagine those as features from service. What you are going to do is you will manually register your service, saying, add a new service to service hub, yeah, you'll come here, okay, and you'll say, here is, here is the location of my service on GitHub. Add magic pipeline in fact if you recall, that is one of things that we had in version one of the app. Yeah. You say, I think, create a service, and then you, so add those buttons.

Unknown Speaker  26:17  
Can you pause. Can you pause?

Speaker 1  26:30  
Okay, yes, yeah, the expectation or so, yeah, it is, it is reasonable to assume that we'll have an will

Unknown Speaker  26:37  
provide an option to the

Suresh Attaluri  26:40  
fact that if we stop doing things like in shortcut ways, because we

Swarup Donepudi  26:45  
will, how do Yeah, so achieve this thing? Yeah? Again, that's why I was not able to pinpoint exact like operations that we use. But I know that we are bypassing a lot of service development features without quantum cloud, yeah, and the more day we stop that, a lot is going to surface here. That's all. And one of them is definitely like, how do I add? Yeah, I see there's a lot around service as a domain object like

Suresh Attaluri  27:17  
I would like to know, what are the databases that my service got connected? I mean, dependencies or any any integration. There's so many things that we can add as soon as somebody says, service catalog, yeah, things. Two important call outs are,

Swarup Donepudi  27:36  
Hey, what is the health of the service? Who owns this service and what are its dependencies? Because if this is failing, the dependencies may be at risk, and these are in large organizations and or if, if, if I want to decommission a service, what all services will be impacted? I'm shutting down. So these are all questions that can if I want to migrate a particular database. What are those connections? I mean, there is so many things that we can do around services, but

Suresh Attaluri  28:12  
as an initial first version of service hub, we are saying these three aspects, I'm looking at three aspects. One is listing which has this information about that service, of which language that it belongs to, who is owner, or who's a person who created it, and all that generic information of service. And then we'll have these options of listing the previous deployment through listing the previous action runs. These are adding GitHub actions

Swarup Donepudi  28:44  
or those things, and then adding it have actions, and we'll,

Suresh Attaluri  28:50  
we'll discuss but use cases, which is, yeah, every life cycle around services. Who owns what? What are its

Swarup Donepudi  29:02  
dependencies? How do I how can I you configure cacd for whether it is even on GitHub or GitHub? So for example, I say, quick action. I want to configure some service, sorry, GitHub actions to service. Then the prompt will be like, Okay, what's your name of the service? And then will be like, Okay, I don't see the service registered in the service, or would you like to register? Yes. And then, okay, where is the GitHub repository? And then we should probably able to figure out, do we have credential GitHub, credential to do any operations on that, like push code to that? If so, yeah, we can add the appropriate So, yeah, I see there's so much thing that can be done at service hub level, and we have been postponed. Yeah, we are postponing it.

Suresh Attaluri  29:58  
We know what. Now. The question boils down to, what is that we can put right now? What or what is what we have on the web page? There are two things. Yeah, we can put what we can think of right now and then incrementally add more things once they are added to the platform.

Speaker 1  30:34  
Okay? So similar to our previous approach, we list down the basic things, and we'll

Swarup Donepudi  30:40  
only simplify the page to only contain those simple things. Yes. Okay, so boots, the life cycle of the services is Bootstrap. First is discover, like see what all you have. So this is already list view in service, hub, Bootstrap. This is source code template library, cookie cutter. Templates also will have Bootstrap and discover at the end. Okay, you write down the news, yeah, okay, Bootstrap and then

Suresh Attaluri  31:12  
CICD, configure, configure, cacd,

Swarup Donepudi  31:16  
configure, CAC, okay, and then operate,

Unknown Speaker  31:24  
I think again. So overlapping, right?

Swarup Donepudi  31:28  
For now, this is it, right? I think, I think we can keep, we can limit our scope, yeah, we can have these three, and then we'll, as we

Suresh Attaluri  31:37  
expand on the service, we'll add more sections to the page. Yes, we'll

Swarup Donepudi  31:42  
keep the scope as less as possible. There is so many things, and we it's, there's a good chance that we can

Suresh Attaluri  31:50  
start picking up all those other things. Yeah, it itself looks like a separate product.

Swarup Donepudi  32:01  
So also,

Suresh Attaluri  32:04  
so there will be three sections for to discover, Bootstrap

Swarup Donepudi  32:07  
and configure CICD

Suresh Attaluri  32:11  
at the top for the video. The automate based on deployments, deployment anywhere. So, yeah, configuring CICD, we can do

Swarup Donepudi  32:20  
it has two steps, build and deploy. Configuration is

Suresh Attaluri  32:25  
different from the deployment itself. Okay? So configure is like, how do you add the configuration

Swarup Donepudi  32:32  
to your repository? And deployment itself is like, what is we provide the automation, right, customize and planta, all of that. This is this path under deployment, then that should not be kept here, I believe, because deployments we already discussed on self service

Suresh Attaluri  32:51  
deployments is here is a different aspect, like the fact that no we support like, customize, so deploy. How

Swarup Donepudi  32:58  
I'm looking at it is like, when we say deployment,

Suresh Attaluri  33:03  
it is the way, how we in CA city, how we configure that deployment step, right? So do we need? Do I know? I don't know if we need to talk. Here is the aspect that I noticed we were on GitHub. And here is to present the same information, but you see it from different lenses all the time. So when somebody

Swarup Donepudi  33:23  
is looking at service of page, he won't be like, Oh, I saw the same information on a different page. So we are saying a story about just services here. And okay, configuring CICD is like, Okay, are you on GitLab? Are you on GitLab? Right? And deployments is like, we are saying our platform allows you to deploy your services to fargate, to land, to ECS or to Kubernetes engine. As part of configure CICD and configuring the deployments part of it. Are

Suresh Attaluri  34:00  
we generating a customized file? Is that what it is when we say, configure CICD, yeah, we will do dot GitHub again. These are all speculations. That's why I'm unable to give you, and

Swarup Donepudi  34:15  
I think the discussion is mostly because of lack of clarity on the design, and you don't see it in action. I didn't see it in action. Yes, you may have, but can we so there will be four categories of deployment. I

Suresh Attaluri  34:31  
already have this thing called deploy anywhere with flexibility, deploy your services to the platform. And it makes sense, right?

Swarup Donepudi  34:40  
And this is so true, so I'm just likely leaving it in there,

Unknown Speaker  34:45  
yes, yes.

Swarup Donepudi  34:47  
And cover bootstrap configure, and that is securely managed configuration

Suresh Attaluri  34:52  
and sequence is another aspect. So I believe we will cover multiple languages

Swarup Donepudi  34:57  
as well. Right when we talk about configure CICD, we

Suresh Attaluri  35:02  
are not limited to one language to for the platform provides this ability to build any software built in multiple languages. Do we need to highlight that? I don't know. Okay, like I'm not. I'm hesitating is we haven't done that yet, doesn't even support so I want to keep the

Swarup Donepudi  35:28  
content that we don't support to as minimal as possible, just a title and a simple line, and once we get it, we can update this page. And I think, based on my conversation with chatgpt, I told exactly what we do for our own services, like we put customers in the repository and we define environment variables, we define secrets. In fact, the way we modeled IAC when it came to microservices was keeping service requirements in mind right when we did say, for example, DynamoDB, we did it from what is possible for what is the possible configuration for DynamoDB table. But when we design microservice, the design actually captures a lot of our experiences in service development, like services have secrets, services have environment variables, services expose ports. Yeah, right. Services require Ingress. So we took all of that into account and created the pulumi module. Designed the API in such a way that it supports these features. And those are the features that we are highlighting. Service hub is not just this page, by the way, service hub again, lack of better name for the title we used it, and that is what you see on the app this part. But service hub is all things service in our system. Okay, so I explained all of this to chatgpt, and it came up with these titles where it says, Ingress, easy Ingress. Setup, same thing. You deploy an API, and we create an ingress endpoint for you, and it goes to the same point that the other guy is saying, commit your code, you get an endpoint back, and we do all of that right and securely manage your configuration and secrets, add environment variables, use config map, again, everything related to services only. So how about we use the same titles? Yeah, and but at the top we'll have these three sections, yes, the

Suresh Attaluri  37:29  
windows part is only discover Bootstrap and configure CICD. I think we can do

Swarup Donepudi  37:35  
development as well if something is missing.

Suresh Attaluri  37:40  
Okay, yeah, as a product, we can do that and discover. We can,

Swarup Donepudi  37:47  
can we quickly go through the scripts,

Suresh Attaluri  37:51  
scripts of how discover would be. Discover would be

Swarup Donepudi  37:56  
that same service or page, and we

Suresh Attaluri  37:58  
can search for we can do that such feature, yes, like, how, what are the go? Like, projects are there, and we can search by name, yeah, and Bootstrap can be done either way. Chat thing. Need a Java gRPC service.

Swarup Donepudi  38:15  
We need to develop the API also, okay, I'll prioritize that lots of to dos from these discussions, Bootstrap and how about discover? Discover can also be done through chat. Yeah. What do you say? Yeah. Who owns

Suresh Attaluri  38:32  
what service? Those are all service definition, APIs, Java,

Swarup Donepudi  38:39  
back end service, or Spring Boot or something like that.

Suresh Attaluri  38:43  
And then we have discover, also, discover services. I think it is already there, available like right

Unknown Speaker  38:55  
now, we can, should be modified, I guess, but service

Suresh Attaluri  39:00  
definition, service definition is just is APA

Swarup Donepudi  39:05  
research, we'll test that Discover

Suresh Attaluri  39:09  
Services. The agent should understand that it is talking about service definitions. And we

Swarup Donepudi  39:16  
have this thing, CIC, configure, CSE, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  39:22  
so these three intents should be covered, but before that,

Speaker 1  39:25  
RPCs are missing, we need to develop those as well.

Suresh Attaluri  39:31  
Those are already to do so I think everywhere.

Swarup Donepudi  39:35  
Okay, so good stuff is done. Configure is also where intent.

Unknown Speaker  39:41  
So we'll wait up until these features are

Swarup Donepudi  39:43  
RPC tested, and then we'll discuss the video script as well. Yeah, what is, yeah, we don't have the working right, so,

Suresh Attaluri  39:52  
so and the rest of the stuff is,

Swarup Donepudi  39:54  
like, all yours are, this is one home. The this itself is good jump start development with ready to use templates, but I don't say why these images. That is what happens when you give if shots to

Suresh Attaluri  40:08  
Yeah, these are not relevant images, right? Okay, no images. Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  40:12  
He came up with whatever he was able to map based

Suresh Attaluri  40:14  
on the words, service of, service of, he

Swarup Donepudi  40:17  
knew that it is service of, so I put this there, but jump start with Tempest. He doesn't know. So he kind of put random stuff. So even on the phone, we can have a short video, GIF with our screen recording, where

Suresh Attaluri  40:32  
we filter with Golang, with Python, we can see we can give that experience, Okay, jump start development with the ready to use templates again, same we can have a similar booting chart of the so we're talking about Bootstrap,

Swarup Donepudi  40:47  
yeah, cookie cutter templates, a small image, right? Maybe the chat conversation itself, or the this thing,

Suresh Attaluri  40:56  
this guy library with just cookie cutter, cutter template

Swarup Donepudi  41:00  
selected. We can do that these filters are not working, I guess. Okay, yeah, showing cookie cutter templates, say, Use Template

Unknown Speaker  41:10  
or button, etc, okay.

Swarup Donepudi  41:16  
Going back, jump start. That is Bootstrap. We can remove a

Speaker 1  41:19  
power or we can, instead of showing sorry, instead

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
of showing a cookie cutter template there,

Suresh Attaluri  41:27  
I don't know, we'll see, we can show the GitHub code itself. I thought cookie cutter template code, but it's okay, even I'm not sure it's blabbering. So let's move on. Well, whatever you said is right. We'll show the platinum clothes screenshot on. Yeah, this one can be removed. Yeah, I think he

Unknown Speaker  41:52  
used AI in a lot of

Swarup Donepudi  41:56  
places. Automate build. So that is configuring cacd, yeah, and this will probably be a screenshot of plant or chat conversation. Oh, okay, automate your build test and

Unknown Speaker  42:12  
different browser pre built GitHub actions and workflows, or that we can show the same screenshot

Swarup Donepudi  42:17  
of the source code template library with just GitHub actions filtered and and a screenshot of saying about we say, configure CICD from plant planta cloud. And we have two parallel in

Suresh Attaluri  42:35  
these files getting appeared on GitHub, something. Okay, my only hesitation, a lot of times, comes from the amount of work it takes to make that

Swarup Donepudi  42:47  
to we don't want to get greedy, yeah, if you haven't noticed, we, I think our to do list has already crossed 500 or something. Yes. So that is why I'm like, What's the simplest stuff that we can put to make make it like for example, right? Now, this is not done make sense, right? But if you put GitHub workflows and action screenshot, okay, you have something related to bills and deployments, and you're saying GitHub actions and stuff, so it makes sense. So less not deploy anywhere with flexibility. This is also probably okay. I see the image also summer sits relevant only, yeah, yeah, because of these,

Suresh Attaluri  43:30  
I guess that's fine. And unified deployment configuration. I think

Swarup Donepudi  43:35  
we'll remove this for now. We'll add it later, securely manage configuration and secrets. We'll put the environment variables and secrets customized screenshots and from two of the repositories. And I think maybe this will also right now we don't have two we are not deploying services to two different places, so unified deployment configuration comes when you have, like, a lambda service or a target service and a micro service Kubernetes sitting next to each other, okay, but the configuration is, yeah, we don't have that right now, so We'll not do that in your setup. I think, yeah, it's definitely a

Suresh Attaluri  44:18  
point right point, just thinking media perspective, what can be but is it through service that we add Ingress, or is it through,

Swarup Donepudi  44:28  
I don't know. Have we? Do

Suresh Attaluri  44:30  
you have any thoughts about it? We do at micro service level, right? The Ingress configuration, yeah, I don't know how at service level it will be micro service service. What is the difference? You mean right now we have it at

Swarup Donepudi  44:51  
this thing, right

Suresh Attaluri  44:53  
micro service level, which is associated with an environment, and it has here. The point is, you, the developer. You use platinum cloud to build your Java REST

Swarup Donepudi  45:06  
API, okay, you will get a inverse end point for you, but at service level, how will I get it? Because I have my service has multiple environments, and I can't have a single URL for all the environment.

Suresh Attaluri  45:18  
We show two URLs. So we have service definition in which we have deployment map and the resource ID of

Swarup Donepudi  45:28  
that for the deployment. We can grab that ingress endpoint and show it so it is for environment, not for service, yeah, not always services. When you're saying even for secrets and stuff, right? It is at environment level only, yeah, and remove the Customize and extend service ecosystem. I think this is good, okay, concluding, I think I don't know it's good more than enough As for this irrelevant, this will be replaced with the videos, itself, videos, and scripts we decided, will come back. Yeah.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f4.iac-workflows.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, the meeting recording began, and we are going to talk about ISC workflows. Flow to you, Suresh,

Suresh Attaluri  0:12  
yeah, ISC workflows, but

Swarup Donepudi  0:17  
remember that this is going to be both Lumi and TerraForm. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  0:23  
and I see some change in the pattern, change in this page. I don't know if that is intentional or for some reason, like the other pages have the content and vertical one after the other, top to bottom. Okay, okay, but here I see this one more appealing, and this side of it is some text, and I believe here on to the right side you like this, that is top to top down way of putting things, and this is left to right way of putting the things right. So I don't know I like this one you can alternate. Might be a personal choice.

Swarup Donepudi  1:17  
One top down, we can say combination of second one to be left, right and then third one to be again center, fourth one to be like, left, right and fifth one to be center. Sixth one, yeah, we can alternate, yeah, yes. Okay.

Suresh Attaluri  1:37  
So again, as all our other discussions, the first thing we'll need to figure out is talk about the title here. The title says deployments with pulumi IAC. That will be changed. That will change to deployments with pulumi slash. How about we mention about the agnostic ability of the platform to make the users choose pulumi Or

Swarup Donepudi  2:10  
nobody wants that. Nobody

Suresh Attaluri  2:13  
wants that. So though we don't want to

Swarup Donepudi  2:19  
ask for it. Yeah, so

Suresh Attaluri  2:21  
yeah, I don't know. One thing that I can tell when I read that heading or title is it's not that catchy, like compared to other feature pages, any other feature pages. That's one thing we are open for the chatgpt to recommend for any recommendations, and coming to subtitle, it says, automate, streamline and scale your multi cloud deployments effortlessly with plant and clouds integrated infrastructure as code, CICD pipeline. Yeah, it, in a way, gives nice one line,

Swarup Donepudi  3:05  
okay, so the title can be better, but subtitle is okay. Subtitle is okay. And here it's going to be a video.

Suresh Attaluri  3:13  
So when we talk about video, my question is, what is that part we when we say IAC workflows, what is the part of plant and plot? We are calling it as Ise workflows. And my understanding correct me if I'm wrong, the stack job creation on when a API resource is modified or any cloud operation made on a deployment component API resource of available on brand and cloud platform. If some modification is done, then that automatically triggers a creates a stack job. This whole behavior of creating stack job for each modification, is what we are calling it as IAC workflow.

Swarup Donepudi  4:05  
Yes, right, yeah. And

Suresh Attaluri  4:07  
when we when, if you want to draw parallels with GitHub, GitHub also has IAC workflows, but the how GitHub operates is someone pushes a commit to GitHub project, it initiates, it triggers a GitHub action, or that's what we are calling it as. That's what ISC workflow at GitHub level. Similar in our case, it's a stack job, stack job.

Swarup Donepudi  4:39  
The key difference is a GitHub by default doesn't come with any IAC workflow at all. Okay? Is you as an organization who is using GitHub, you need to find somebody who can set those things up for you, meaning, it needs to be like GitHub action and then also create experience. It's not integrated into GitHub,

Suresh Attaluri  4:59  
but here we provide both, right? We provide customization also, like you can put your own definitions for your Git,

Swarup Donepudi  5:11  
taking away the ability for you to do the same exact thing. Like you put your manifest in GitHub. You add a GitHub action, you may come into that configuration, same GitHub action, nothing, no change. No. I'm

Suresh Attaluri  5:26  
saying, I'm talking about IAC workflows. You said there won't be any predefined IAC workflows at GitHub level, yeah. But when we are saying that there will we have an effect on plant and cloud with predefined ASU workflow setup, right? They get triggered. How is that possible? Is because there are certain the platform itself provides some pulumi module modules,

Swarup Donepudi  5:55  
and the important part for the Integrated workflows is not about the pulumi modules that we created, they play an important role. However, we build the system in such a way that every modification to configuration will automatically trigger a refresh, followed by a preview and followed by an apply or update step. So whether it is TerraForm or pulumi, according to stack job configuration, the automatic triggering of that without you having to do anything. And also the workflow is, it is these workflows are very well aware of the infrastructure as code tooling, meaning there is refresh, there is preview, and there is apply or update. Nobody needs to learn anything new. Nobody needs to configure anything new, right? So the integrated IC IAC workflows like GitHub has, it has a like a automate all solution in the form of actions. So there is no first class support for like these preview so you won't see them nicely lined up unless you do something there. And there is state backing that is, again, you need to set something up there that comes out of the box. And there is nice integrations that we provided, like you connect your pumi or your TerraForm those back ends, and the application, the platform that we have built has first class support for all of these. We recognize pulling the back end as a thing. We allow the users to configure it, or we provide one out of the box, and provider credentials is a first class citizen on our system. So all these, what do

Suresh Attaluri  7:39  
you think that we need to put all those things here, we should have a separate, connect specific feature, or, I don't know, those adding from

Swarup Donepudi  7:53  
like, what is the value offered by plan term cloud in The form of integrated IAC workflows, is you make modifications to your configuration out of the box. You you get IAC experience of preview, refresh, all of that. Okay, along with the credential management, I'm not talking about the possibility of connecting something in connections page. I'm saying we built the system of this IAC, where credentials are in play an important role, just came back and plays an important role. And we built those things into and we have put together a nice system for you which covers all these aspects. You don't have to do anything. So, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  8:37  
yeah, I think we establish the scope of this feature, I believe I surf flows, make some modification. What is the effect? Is triggering this tag draw with which has refresh preview and apply?

Swarup Donepudi  8:54  
Yeah. So let's talk about the video script. Video Script, I'll tell you the script. Tell me, if that makes sense, yes. So the video begins with saying, as a developer, I want to deploy DynamoDB table.

Suresh Attaluri  9:10  
And this you do through and

Swarup Donepudi  9:12  
the way you do a chat, chat, you begin with chat, and we say, when the DynamoDB table is being deployed, you see pulumi review, refresh automatically trigger and execute. So

Suresh Attaluri  9:24  
user will put the intent and will cut the duration, cut the video to this thing, the pulumi stack this thing. Okay, yeah, and we'll show that refresh coming up. And

Swarup Donepudi  9:44  
we highlight those aspects in this video, in this video, not the chat parts, but we say, notice how the automatically, there is a pulumi Refresh so or TerraForm refresh, or TerraForm plan or apply without you having to do anything.

Suresh Attaluri  9:59  
Do we need? Do you think we need to also mention about the pulumi module and the resources that are being created here? That

Swarup Donepudi  10:05  
is the next step, which is for without what would have what would you have done without this experience is you would set up something on your computer like you would configure a machine to with pulumi state backend. These are all things that you need in order for this to work, TerraForm state backend, store. TerraForm state you need TerraForm module to run, and you need a central server to run the TerraForm these steps. All of that is done for you. The TerraForm state backend is already provided. TerraForm. What is it? What is it? I said, three things, state backend, the runner. I said, the second. Module, module, yeah. So you're getting the state back and out of the box. Your, there are default modules for everything, and your the stack job runner is also provided for so don't do anything. All of that comes out of the box. And also, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  11:14  
but do you think you need to? We need to show the we need to. How will you demo it? We verbally saying that this at the back end. These three are, or again, or we jump, or we only choose to show the pulumi module. I don't know if we can show the back, pulumi back and as in, in visible form. So these

Swarup Donepudi  11:38  
are also concepts, right? Yeah. So this will go into iPad. This

Suresh Attaluri  11:43  
can go into the thing, right? You need to set up this so we can consider

Swarup Donepudi  11:48  
so it's very easy to do something like, for example, if I open a video, yesterday's video, and I say, explainer, right? So if you watch this video, you will see I've done something to show things. You see this while I'm explaining this, right, while I while I'm on the console app, talking about saying to achieve the same exact thing you would need plumi back and pulumi module. I can do a white like iPad explanation as a side creation. Then we can include that here. We can play that video here as well. Yeah, as we speak, we can say you need pulumi module. You would need a stack job runner as

Suresh Attaluri  12:42  
a computer. The whole point is this part that you need all these things to be set up will fall under the problem section of it. I don't think it will be coming into this video, the main hero section video, we only show the user putting the intent on the chart and its stack job being triggered, the stack job will have the link of pulumi module, like that's the feature that we are planning to implement.

Swarup Donepudi  13:13  
Yeah, the as as you update the configuration, it got deferred, and you are able to see the live progress and control the history the deployment component store. This is all you can deploy using these Ise workflows. And here is the module registry. I think we can simply just show the whole thing, instead of being like, Yeah, I like the aspect that you brought up, which is, don't go into like, what would happen if you don't have these and that you'll simply show what we have in the platform. That is the easiest way for us to do it, right, like,

Suresh Attaluri  13:43  
or even we can end it using giving the intent and,

Swarup Donepudi  13:48  
yeah, this is okay. I just deployed the table. But here is all the stuff that your developers can deploy by showing deployment component, store, no, no that comes

Suresh Attaluri  13:58  
under the service, service, self service thing, right? Let's not mix. The only point is keep as precise as possible and as targeted.

Swarup Donepudi  14:08  
Integrated IAC workflows only showing as soon as I did something, the workflow is already integrated. It's triggering. It's

Suresh Attaluri  14:16  
triggering. You have the refresh. You see the refresh says that it has some back end state back end, and you're getting the these things, and you we have the other things. And we can make a choice of modifying, okay, we can do this refresh. We can do two things. We create a DynamoDB, modify it, and we can show that the Refresh is now changed in a way that talks about the back end as well, right? Yeah, stay back. And it's not, it's not a stateless thing that's being done. And, yeah, we'll explain. We'll talk about the resources that are there on the stack job blocks.

Swarup Donepudi  14:59  
Are we good? Yeah, yeah, this is the video, and it says, built in IAC workflow. It just works. And we'll have, we'll have

Suresh Attaluri  15:09  
stack job screenshot, job lock, screenshot,

Swarup Donepudi  15:12  
screenshot here, stack job bundles, columi operations, again, I think this is good enough.

Suresh Attaluri  15:19  
Yeah. Number here, it would be, instead of using pulumi, we can use pulumi slash TerraForm operation, so something of that. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  15:32  
and advanced flow controls. I think this is good enough customers with advanced this is what we provide to i I configure previous approvals, execution steps. Yeah, this is all part of the same thing, real time monitoring and a generated summaries.

Suresh Attaluri  15:56  
Real time monitoring and a generated summaries. So I'll remove, what is this?

Swarup Donepudi  16:02  
I'll remove real time monitoring here. I'll just have a generated summaries.

Suresh Attaluri  16:07  
Do we have that? Oh, we were planning to do that, right? Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Can come down. What is the other No, no, sorry, not down. Okay. Advanced flow controllers. You're

Swarup Donepudi  16:19  
good. Real time monitoring will be removed. A generated summaries says our real time monitor is our terminal, like interface, storage, complex logs into understandable and this will be a screenshot of a generate is real

Suresh Attaluri  16:39  
time monitoring is that one, which, which you we used to highlight earlier, which we used to call real time logs

Swarup Donepudi  16:48  
like terminal like interface on the web,

Suresh Attaluri  16:52  
the logs only right the what are the resources that are being we can still mention Right, terminal

Swarup Donepudi  16:58  
like interface. These two should not have been combined, combined, yeah, terminal, like, interface on web,

Suresh Attaluri  17:09  
yeah, real real time updates. Real time updates, right? Isn't it? Okay? Real time monitoring or okay thing, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  17:18  
real time not monitoring, I

Suresh Attaluri  17:23  
don't see the value of terminal like,

Swarup Donepudi  17:27  
interface, even real time monitoring is probably, I don't know, going back to what you mentioned, which is, like, people on the like, see that, like, Oh, Does it provide real time monitoring? That's great. I don't think that's the case. Okay, okay, you are basically like GitHub, when you run an action, they are not claiming that, oh, as the action is getting executed, you can see the real time progress of the action. Yes, yes. It's obvious. Like, action only you're seeing Yes.

Suresh Attaluri  18:01  
But the reason that earlier, when we were trying to highlight this part of the product, the reason was no one else was providing this feature other IDP solutions, they were just

Swarup Donepudi  18:17  
showing a view, we don't know, not showing the terminal like progress, but not they are showing real demo, okay, but not the terminal like interface. And this point, we kind of discarded down.

Suresh Attaluri  18:32  
Let's have a generated summaries, and we'll have

Swarup Donepudi  18:35  
a generated summaries as the section, yeah, and this is a generated summary, complex logs into understandable, yeah, jump straight will be removed. This is copy pasted from somewhere. Multi cloud varies. I think it is also from copy paste from somewhere we remove that enhanced control with custom stack job runners. So this will be like, the will show connections page with,

Suresh Attaluri  19:06  
okay, instance to control custom stack job runners, okay, so Ise runners, right? That's what we meant. Okay,

Swarup Donepudi  19:17  
I'll simply put a connections screenshot, yes, yes. And highlight,

Suresh Attaluri  19:21  
like, bring it, bring their own runners concept, okay, yeah, we can Yes, this is not discussed at the top, but we are saying like this, five secure

Swarup Donepudi  19:35  
and flexible credential management, manage provider credentials, and pull me straight back and securely communicate various levels. Various levels. And this one again, connection management,

Suresh Attaluri  19:50  
okay, but does this fall under ISC, both the stack job thing, also of stack job? Yeah, it is, in a way, connected the this part credential management.

Swarup Donepudi  20:09  
Okay, we'll remove it,

Suresh Attaluri  20:11  
or we can say secure way of connecting state

Swarup Donepudi  20:17  
backends. I think at this point I am kind of burdened with so much to do. So we'll remove the okay to remove parts. No can react them if needed

Suresh Attaluri  20:28  
collaboration and transparency, of course. Again, this, I don't see this thing,

Swarup Donepudi  20:34  
deployment, industries and children. This can go into the auditable intelligence. So I'll remove these two sections. Okay, cool.

Suresh Attaluri  20:45  
I think that covers. I see one source, kind of a shorter width.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f5.k8s-dashboard.p1.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:21  
Okay, I moved the camera. But because you want to be covered. The camera is here

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
should come this. So, okay,

Swarup Donepudi  0:57  
okay, cool, all right, so let's begin the discussion. We have time boxed into 20 minutes, and the goal is to finish one of the next feature. We already finished our plan to app so we'll move on to self service DevOps. What do you think we can cover in 20 minutes? I

Suresh Attaluri  1:15  
think self service jobs is a bigger feature to a topic. I think Kubernetes dashboard is smaller,

Swarup Donepudi  1:24  
okay, all right, so the hero section here says secure and simplified Kubernetes access. And the goal here is, why did we build the Kubernetes dashboard is there are a lot of Kubernetes dashboard applications like dedicated so they have extensive support for every single feature available on Kubernetes. But that is not the goal for us to build this feature into our own product. The goal is to build an application or service centric view into Kubernetes and any operations that the service owners need to perform, we are trying to simplify it for them, meaning those the dashboards that typically exist outside may are still totally relevant. We don't recommend replacing those with this solution, but we are, because we are an internal developer platform which focuses on developer experience, starting from bootstrapping all the way to day two, plus operations, that is post deployment operations, obviously, devs would need a few tools to interact with their services, whether they are in lower environments like dev or staging or even in production. And me being a platform engineer or a Kubernetes engineer, for a long time, I have seen this use case across many companies. While there is a lot that Kubernetes can offer via dashboards, there is a few set of actions that most of the developers rely on in order to efficiently troubleshoot or do any type of post deployment operations with their services. So we I, because I have experience, and I kind of identified those set of core, core set of tools and functions needed for developers on Kubernetes, we built just that. Okay, so again, reiterating the fact that this is not a full blown Kubernetes dashboard. This is only a minified but effective doing the most frequently used actions only with that. Yeah, go on.

Suresh Attaluri  3:40  
So I think you covered most of it, but looking in the context of a website, feature page, yeah, we have these two things, right, title and subtitle, yes, that's what we need to figure it out. Title, it says secure and simplified Kubernetes access. The theme of our titles is catchy line to

Suresh Attaluri  4:05  
offer feature, yeah. So I think that's already yeah serves a purpose. I

Swarup Donepudi  4:10  
think again I get I did the same type of exercise with the rich, and took all the transcription and provided it to chatgpt, and I explained the whole thing, and it gave a set of subtitles. And we have like, three different alternatives. I finalized this one, so we have two more. We can take a look at them. But since we both are on agreement that this is a reasonable and stuff. So yeah, I also Yeah, I want to highlight what those top five, top few, Kubernetes tools before that. Do you have anything to say?

Suresh Attaluri  4:49  
Yeah, same point like subtitle. Case again, the theme of subtitle is to tell what users can do with this feature, right So, and now it's a streamline your day to operations and accelerate development with plant and cloud. Yeah, which is still okay, reasonable, but we are okay if planned and chatgpt gives us any other suggestions, and to do that, I believe we can give more context of what are those operations? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  5:22  
I just that also crossed my mind to instead of hiding those, saving them for the later sections of the page, maybe the subtitle is a good place to simply highlight what those five or six different things, because those are not a lot. And just like for example, instead of saying streamline your day to operations at accelerate development with plant on cloud, that doesn't really provide a lot of value, there, maybe streamline your day to Ops is good, but the rest of is like in sales messaging. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  5:57  
I don't know if day two operations is a jargon word which everyone would identify, or

Swarup Donepudi  6:04  
I think identify the intended target audience for this will definitely be the developers, like individual developers or technical founders who started their company, etc. And for them, if we can highlight that, hey, you can exec into your container, you can stream the logs of your pods, or your developers can do it without having to set up COVID config. They can also update like explore Kubernetes resources, yaml, cited them all that from right, either using plankton CLI or dashboard. Maybe we'll again wait for chatgpt to provide us some with reasonable size of these, these things, yeah. So one of the goals for chatgpt to give me as an action item would be to rewrite or make another attempt to write a better subtitle for the hero section or even but can also do hero section before

Suresh Attaluri  6:57  
that, we need to discuss, what are those five operations, right? Yeah? Yes,

Swarup Donepudi  7:01  
those actions are to me. First of all, whenever I go to any Kubernetes dashboard, first of all, the very first thing that I want I do is filter out things so that I can find the appropriate Kubernetes services that are created for my service to do its work. Okay, okay. And

Suresh Attaluri  7:20  
how will that help any person in an organization like, will it be useful for a developer or DevOps engineer or some other role in the company will be using this?

Swarup Donepudi  7:37  
This aspect of our product is heavily created with a good developer in mind. Okay, not DevOps engineers. DevOps engineers, we believe, are capable of

Suresh Attaluri  7:47  
undoing about the service listing services part, which is not services,

Swarup Donepudi  7:52  
not listing services. Say I am working on one of the micro service within the company, okay, okay. And I want to know, I want to quickly access any Kubernetes resources that are created for my only service. Like, for example, I'm working on payment service, okay? And I only, I only care about the stuff that is on Kubernetes to make my service work, because that is where what I am here for. So what is the value there is. I want to know how many parts are running. I want to know how the deployment resource is configured. How will

Suresh Attaluri  8:30  
any typical developer will know

Swarup Donepudi  8:32  
this information? This information? Yeah, so far. So

Suresh Attaluri  8:36  
do we have any categories of these data operations? I mean, I'm just trying to drill down each option that we are providing, right? So first thing that you said is about pots. If someone want to look at how many Kubernetes pots are running, and for a particular microservice, that

Swarup Donepudi  8:55  
wouldn't be a typical requirement, and that might also be a requirement in some cases, like a is this one part, or is this four parts? Because the request seems to be going like to multiple parts. So something wrong with the load balancing? So that is one of the use cases. Are you referring to the with plantain cloud versus without life before platinum cloud?

Suresh Attaluri  9:19  
I want to know where this information is available on

Swarup Donepudi  9:25  
your asking you to show where

Suresh Attaluri  9:27  
it is available, how anyone can look at it,

Swarup Donepudi  9:30  
so we can go to one of our Redis deployments. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  9:34  
okay, and release, deployed on Kubernetes, deployed on

Swarup Donepudi  9:39  
Kubernetes production environment. So I looked up for the Redis deployment, and then I clicked on the Kubernetes icon, which displays all the Kubernetes resources that are created in the namespace that is created to deploy this Redis Kubernetes. And these are native Kubernetes resources. And we are, at this point, we are fetching everything and just displaying them as a list, yeah, however, yeah. But this is how you developers can surface this that information, yes.

Suresh Attaluri  10:11  
So, but there is developer has to go through all these resources and look at the parts and see, okay, right now, here I see yeah in the view one part, yeah, and with that name, yeah. So

Swarup Donepudi  10:23  
we do have plans to expand this experience via this thing canvas, similar to how we, the developer, is able to explore all the deployed resources are on Canvas Explorer, we are also going to leverage the same user experience to create what is called Kubernetes Explorer, or resources explorer. Okay, so we will represent the parts visually using cards or using the pod icon and stuff, and we are going to only show the most commonly, like, interesting resources was just showing everything.

Suresh Attaluri  11:03  
That was my next point. Yeah. Developer, yeah, I don't know. I never looked at all these other resources, right? The pod is one thing which

Swarup Donepudi  11:13  
there will be a few important ones. For example, persistent volume secret endpoints are nobody cares about it, unless you are like troubleshooting some networking issue. Service is another important resource parties, another important resource service account is another one still full set is loop and ungroup.

Suresh Attaluri  11:32  
How to make this view better? Will be a different discussion. But yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  11:37  
overall, totally. So we do have an important story that we are trying to prioritize quickly, which is to improve this Kubernetes explore on Canvas, and also, like visualize only those important things and provide filters to search for others one and also searching stuff, etc. So,

Suresh Attaluri  11:57  
but right now we have this list view, yeah, so, and there's just a read view, right? Yeah, this

Swarup Donepudi  12:01  
is a list view, read view, and a developer can drill into one particular resource, like, for example, they want to see if the state full set is configured with the right amount of CPU

Suresh Attaluri  12:16  
limits or not, okay, the specification of that resource on COVID, yeah, right, a person can, I mean, a user can, yeah, it

Swarup Donepudi  12:23  
would be, it would be similar to kubectl get StatefulSet and main hyphen master with the hyphen end and the name of the namespace. That is equivalent to me clicking on the StatefulSet entry, and it shows me the YAML and also hyphen, O, yaml, you so on coupe, CTL, yeah. So we

Suresh Attaluri  12:45  
are listing the resources also. We are providing this option of viewing the spec of that, yeah. We are providing all CRUD operations, CRUD operations also on that, yeah, specification,

Swarup Donepudi  12:58  
okay, yeah, on resources and on each resource, okay, okay, like I can edit this right we are looking at state to set, and we can definitely edit this file right here. And I'm also like looking at environment variables, ports and resources. CPU limit is set to 50. I can update it to 250 right here, and immediately I can save it. That is like, update,

Suresh Attaluri  13:24  
okay, okay, so we are simplifying the access part, also for the developer, right like DevOps engineer, who's who set up this Kubernetes cluster, cluster, they have to set up the they would provide that access specific to each developer. They are going to develop, get access of these developers laptop and somehow set up that thing and provide access, but with our simplified access management,

Swarup Donepudi  13:56  
yeah, that is another key important aspect of this whole, which is the reason why we integrated Kubernetes Dashboard right alongside services. Here is to avoid that extra hassle of setting up config, like the authorization and authentication to Kubernetes cluster itself. It is a very big hassle. Usually the people do share COVID config with other developers, which has permissions to do everything, but it is hard to identify who performed what actions, so no audit is available. At least with plant on Cloud, Iam sitting in between the developers and their Kubernetes clusters. At least we do have a trail of what actions are performed by which user on plant on

Suresh Attaluri  14:39  
cloud, so that will be audited right like

Swarup Donepudi  14:42  
right now we are not auditing, but we did, I did consider in the past of auditing these API calls. Obviously, we know which API call is being made and what is the pay request payload and modification and all that. So yeah, we have the opportunity to do that as well right now, but we are not providing

Suresh Attaluri  15:02  
it yet. This Kubernetes providing that, if someone

Swarup Donepudi  15:06  
just like the way, AWS doesn't provide washing and auditing capabilities, the Kubernetes doesn't

Suresh Attaluri  15:12  
Kubernetes CL, if you use Kubernetes CLI, or any other form of modifying

Swarup Donepudi  15:18  
it, also tools to do that. Well, it's not an out of box experience.

Suresh Attaluri  15:23  
Someone has to do some extra effort and set it up.

Swarup Donepudi  15:25  
Yeah, true. So plantain products is acting, acting as a proxy between the actual Kubernetes cluster and the developers, and without any hassle of setting up the access, he's able to do these day one or day two operations

Suresh Attaluri  15:39  
as me being a developer, yeah, the other tasks that I remember is modifying deployment, like, if I have to add any environment,

Swarup Donepudi  15:47  
yeah, this is what we are talking about right now. And I believe that, yeah, another environment variable you can add, update the resources you can Yeah, you can do all sorts of edits. The way you do it using kubectl.

Suresh Attaluri  16:00  
So that covers,

Swarup Donepudi  16:03  
yeah. We are also providing a describe view. So this is equal to coupe CTL describe and the resource parameter, yeah, that is YAML view you can also edit, yeah. So, yeah, going back,

Suresh Attaluri  16:18  
yeah, yeah. Apart from this, the next thing would be accepting and seeing. So, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:24  
you can also, important, more importantly, you can also do a lot stream logs of a container. Okay, so, so you can click on pod logs, streaming pod logs, and you will be able to, you will also be able to apply some filters, like how much of this is equivalent to doing coupe CTL logs, or in fact, we did what is called Stern. Stern is a better tool, but it is not a Kubernetes native tool. It is a shell abstraction on coupe CTL. Yeah. It basically combines logs from multiple tools based on the provided filters. We simulated stern like logs right on. So I think chatgpt can make a note that, since Stern is a very big popular tool, stern is available on plant on Cloud, either via plant on CLI itself or via the console app. Okay, any so that is logs. And you mentioned about being able to exec into container, right? Yeah, so that is also available. So I can go back to the Kubernetes resources, I can click on exec into the container. So I need to select a part. I need to select exec into container, and it displays the list of containers that are available in the part. And I need to provide type, this type of shell I want to and I can I already accept into

Unknown Speaker  17:46  
it, yeah, so I can do all,

Swarup Donepudi  17:48  
yeah, you are essentially in cell, and we give web part. So, yeah, this is another thing that is loved by developers, having being able to directly exit into their part container, because that gives them a lot of tooling readily available to do more kind of troubleshooting, etc. You can expand

Suresh Attaluri  18:05  
the good use cases, like, what is the environment variable on the part or on the container? Yep.

Swarup Donepudi  18:14  
So yeah, I think we covered most also, what to summarize perform CRUD operations on the Kubernetes resources specific to your service, right in your alongside your service, you can access all of that. You will be able to perform crud on the resources themselves. You can do coup CTL get kubectl edit, kubectl delete, kubectl etc. You can do kubectl logs, which is actually stern locks, which is more improvised tool, and you can do COVID exec into container, or you can exec in, yeah, exec into another container. So these are the things that are available, and improvement planned. Improvements are definitely the canvas exploring. So we want to provide a better user experience on the console app. To do better,

Suresh Attaluri  19:00  
but future, yeah. Thing to do, yeah, so we'll

Swarup Donepudi  19:04  
conclude the meeting here. Okay, and we'll continue the next meeting with the starting with the script for the main video itself. Maybe we can also do four different smaller videos where we are showing the exploration part, being able to do some operations like edit the resources and being able to exit into container and being able to log, stream logs. Are you talking about the video script? Yeah, we'll do four smaller videos. We'll begin our next conversation around the scripts for each either each of the videos or four different videos. Okay, I'm stopping this here. Any closing notes, no, no. Okay, perfect.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f5.k8s-dashboard.p2.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:00  
Yeah, okay, so going back, yeah, we are doing that problem on every page, oh,

Suresh Attaluri  0:06  
problem on everything that

Swarup Donepudi  0:09  
or not, it's not, probably consistent, I guess I don't know, deployments, yeah, this one, we are not like articulating clear problem or anything.

Suresh Attaluri  0:21  
Yeah, well, that we can take decision, right? But in case of Kubernetes dashboard, let's decide if it has problem should be there or not, and what is the current problem. And applications move from local deploy development to Kubernetes clusters, unexpected behaviors can raise accessing logs, environment variables and configurations becomes a hurdle without the right tools. Plant and cloud addresses these pain points ahead on.

Swarup Donepudi  0:50  
So maybe this can be refreshed to say again the same thing, right? I explained why we built it in first place in great detail in our previous conversation. So I'll rely on chat GPT to give us a better like problem statement based on that description. Yes, this is more like a much broader goal claim.

Suresh Attaluri  1:13  
How about the image? Are we still good with the image? Or maybe we

Swarup Donepudi  1:18  
can add screenshots and screenshots of

Suresh Attaluri  1:24  
execing into a board that looks fancy, I believe. So we we add some commands, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  1:31  
maybe we can add multiple cards here, saying, I want the problem, clearly, calling out the problems, saying, I would like to, like, modify the Kubernetes resource directly. I would like to exec into a pod container. Or we can put the screenshots of each of those, but that might also become redundant. That's like a solution, right? This is more like a problem statement area if you directly put the screenshots of our app, we are saying, This is how we should. How

Suresh Attaluri  2:05  
about we put a video here as well and explain the problem? Okay, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  2:10  
that is also okay.

Suresh Attaluri  2:17  
Problems, I believe, are more I see the nature of problem. Can't we put put it through a screenshot or image? Right? The font could be more verbal. I mean, I'm talking in context of all the problem statements that we are going to decide, okay, and finding a single image to explain a problem. Yeah, might be difficult. Like for solution, we have a form, right? Like when we talk about Kubernetes dashboard as a solution, we can put on some images

Swarup Donepudi  2:51  
from the app, from the app. For all solutions, yeah, we can come up with the screenshots or recordings from the app. But when talking about the problem itself. That is when. So all problem statements will do video.

Suresh Attaluri  3:08  
We'll do that.

Swarup Donepudi  3:09  
Yeah, I think that's more better. Like, why we did it? Why did we decide to build Kubernetes dashboard? Why did we build IAC workflows, even for IAC, even for plantora, for everything we do, we have a while, which is very difficult to explain in using these creatives, infographics or, yeah, that becomes that requires, you know, creativity which we lack, I guess, yeah, so I think videos straightforward. We can do it. No creativity required. We'll have a little extra time to cover a lot of like, explain the problem. So, too. So, yeah, yes, I know. So we will put a video directly here, saying, watch the video to understand why we built this, and we'll see how, if you're going is going to style it. And for me, except for the landing page, for me, I think the rest of the pages are more about not being fancy, but more being like informative, a new platform, new product in the market. The more information we provide, we cannot that we will never be able to convince a future customer of ours, whether they are one developer or two developer or 10 developer company with our like, amazing website. Yeah, it's always about the problems the solutions. So yeah, I think I'm not too worried about whether or not putting a video here makes a website look ugly or beautiful, yes, but

Suresh Attaluri  4:44  
yeah, I think we can always have a thumbnail, fancy thumbnail, to keep it Yeah. Next thing, yeah, here we can put a simplified communities. Day two operations. How about we'll

Swarup Donepudi  5:03  
do just one, one section for each of the problem, for

Suresh Attaluri  5:07  
each of the problem. Yeah, no need for what is, what is the problem, these ones, so each of the solutions, right?

Swarup Donepudi  5:14  
Okay, yeah. So Operation challenge, we are already covering it.

Suresh Attaluri  5:18  
Yeah. We covered the problem, and we show those sub features or what solutions that we listed already, the four of them or three of them on this listing. And crud, I also

Swarup Donepudi  5:32  
need to remove i Okay, forgot to give a better prompt to chatgpt where I wanted all the statements to be passive context, but it gave it in like we act. Discover how it is active context. So I like to update those meaning. Discover how. Not a good statement here, but okay, so should it be? It should have been like a plant on Cloud transforms the way developers not discover how, okay, discover how is, like, you're asking the user to do something next, but we don't do anything there. Like, yeah, maybe, maybe the prompt that I gave it was, like, I'll put some type of video next to each section. So it may have assumed that there is going to be a video here. So discord, how means, watch the video. So, okay, simplified Kubernetes data operation. So platinum pro transforms away developers handle post deployment challenges in Kubernetes environments. It simplifies operational tasks so you can so devs can focus on building great applications without getting bogged down by infrastructure complexities. Yes, so maybe we can keep this as well. And this is also like a good infographic, and we'll leave it at that. Okay, and no need for Direct cluster access, again, some same thing that we would explain here in the operational space. We are explicitly calling out that too. For those who don't watch the video, I

Suresh Attaluri  7:09  
think this should be at the top and then simplified, oh, we all also have other sections. My point is, oh, okay, okay. We have, okay, we have those sections, and then real

Swarup Donepudi  7:24  
time, log, streaming, execute comments inside. This is more

Suresh Attaluri  7:29  
the stuff that we talked about

Swarup Donepudi  7:34  
based on our discussion. I'll, I'll see if I can come up with updated sections for this. But okay, I think at this point,

Suresh Attaluri  7:43  
I think every section will have a screenshot as a media media friend, as for these,

Swarup Donepudi  7:49  
like fancy icons, we leave it for shaft to decide he'll use those to make the page look less boring, I guess. But we'll take the screenshots from the same videos that we record. I think, I think I have sufficient content to at least get the first content version out.

Suresh Attaluri  8:12  
So, and I see a lot of things written after this point. What is

Swarup Donepudi  8:15  
it edit Kubernetes on the fly, which is probably similar to we will manage Kubernetes. So this is like a read, I guess, and manage may include edit as well, according to us, but this one says it's

Suresh Attaluri  8:30  
about editing. What is other section,

Swarup Donepudi  8:33  
enhanced permission, manage security. So this is already like this is talking about. I think this will fall under no direct Kubernetes access required. This is duplicates and use cases again. I think this can be removed. This section two and

Suresh Attaluri  8:52  
debugging made simple. What are these sections?

Swarup Donepudi  8:56  
Yeah, this can be removed. Yeah, yeah, good. I think it doesn't have to be like, purposefully long, yes, making our job difficult to complete the page. Actually, I'll take care of removing unneeded parts as discussed. Okay, you have any closing remark? Or

Suresh Attaluri  9:19  
can I stop? No, I think we can consider the two minutes dashboard has done.


## /Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai/workspace/media-discussions/transcriptions/02-features/f6.auditable-intelligence.md
Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, floor to use,

Suresh Attaluri  0:04  
okay, so this is about altable intelligence as a feature on plant and cloud platform. So, so the feature even, yeah, I'm not sure about what exactly auditable intelligence as a feature is, but when I just look at the name, it might refer to the modifications that we make on our API resources and the stack jobs that it gets triggered. Okay, we'll discuss what is the feature is all about. But coming to all the title and subtitle part which already have, which we already have. It on figma, it says, achieve full transparency with auditable intelligence. That's the title of the feature, and the subtitle section says it's simplify compliance and collaboration with auditable intelligence from planned and code. Okay, so let's discuss how this thing or how this auditability is achieved in the platform. Anything that you want to highlight here, Swarup as part of auditability,

Swarup Donepudi  1:28  
we'll keep it simple. We'll simply say developers can deploy various

Suresh Attaluri  1:39  
components

Swarup Donepudi  1:41  
and across any cloud provider, okay? And each component has a lot of configuration associated with it. Yes, change. Changing the configuration has a direct impact on the availability of services or the systems, okay? So it's important for organizations to be able to quickly understand what are those configuration changes, and that is one of the biggest reasons why every organization will prefer IAC infrastructure as code, as opposed to allowing developers to modify resources on AWS, because there is no centralized view on on that versioning, like when you do IAC, you're doing it in the form of code. When you're writing code, you have the power of Git, which so you can leverage the ecosystem, Git ecosystem, via GitHub and stuff where there is commits and all that diff view, etc, right? So that is why there is a lot of push towards using IAC versus this. So for the same exact reasons, we made sure that, for those reasons, for the same reasons, that organizations will prefer IAC over using web interfaces. Yeah, at the heart of that is definitely the auditability. What, and what is the impact of those changes on the infrastructure, so

Suresh Attaluri  3:08  
users who would like to know who made the modification, when they have made the modification, and what is the modification, it's all about. But saying all that GitHub, already has those features if you put your infrastructure as code on to as a as a GitHub repository. But since we are bringing the configuration to to an API. We are moving from a GitHub file, we are bringing

Swarup Donepudi  3:47  
the whole idea of self service is to provide the simplest way for developers to deploy and GitHub repositories, and putting configuration in GitHub is again another friction, which is not Yeah, which is not as efficient from a self service perspective as like, the chat interface or anything,

Suresh Attaluri  4:06  
right? Yeah, whatever it is, we took the decision that we move the configuration from a GitHub file to an API.

Swarup Donepudi  4:14  
Well even, okay, yeah, so,

Suresh Attaluri  4:17  
and now, by doing that, we lost the power of that GitHub auditability of knowing when then we in planting Cloud Platform. Also we had to build a similar ability to identify when that configuration has been modified and who and what has been modified. I mean, am I putting it right?

Swarup Donepudi  4:41  
Yeah, so we didn't take away that ability of putting the configuration in GitHub. The configuration can still, like users can go to GitHub, and this can actually be a demo. They can create a repo, and they can call it as Redis, my Redis Database, okay? And they will create a file called Redis dot yaml, and they will put ABA version, Redis, Kubernetes,

Suresh Attaluri  5:08  
all of that, all the API application specification changes.

Swarup Donepudi  5:11  
Here they can use Version controlling Yes, so they are getting that version controlling if they choose to Yes, but we are providing the self service capabilities via conversational interfaces or key cops, right? So we are saying auditable intelligence, which is we are providing the artificial intelligence yet we are retaining the auditability. Yes, so, but you're right in a way that there is no additional problem we are solving here. Yes, we are simply highlighting that even though, see, for example, why did you not use AWS in the first place? Is lack of transparency, yes, and there is no central view for an organization to know who made what when and what is and we are simply presenting to the audience that, yeah, we have like you can expect something better from us. People click buttons, but everything is

Suresh Attaluri  6:14  
audited. You're moving away from it not using GitHub to manage your configs, by not using a GitHub to manage your countries, you are not losing anything. You have. You have all that auditability, definitely

Swarup Donepudi  6:30  
doing anything better, but at least we have not taken like, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  6:35  
you you have all the information here as well. That's what the point is. And coming to the Okay, how about the I see heading is good enough, and the subtitle as well simplify compliance and collaboration with orthogonal Yes. And what now, when we talk about video, what part of the plant and cloud is that we need to show to users.

Swarup Donepudi  7:04  
Start with the chat conversation. Okay, we can say demodb, table, hash key, no,

Suresh Attaluri  7:11  
but which part of it is considered as or as auditable, like IAC workflows, we show stack job blocks,

Swarup Donepudi  7:21  
so we start with stack the chat. Let me deploy something which is a DNA, more DB table, okay? And we update the hash key name from X to Y, okay, okay. And we go back to the dashboard and look up that resource, go to its version history and show that, okay, so see how the changes are being captured, and also see that every change has an associated

Suresh Attaluri  7:46  
job. And you know that this change has deployed or not, yeah, you by correlating with

Swarup Donepudi  7:54  
within that stack job. And then I'll show you a quick example of that, which is AWS, VI, N,

demo table. Okay, so I changed the update hash key from lock, ID to lock, no,

Suresh Attaluri  8:27  
okay, okay. And

Swarup Donepudi  8:31  
you can see in the div section that, in the div section it says, One day, one will be replaced. Okay, okay. Why is it replacing? Because you changed the name from lock ID to lock. No,

Suresh Attaluri  8:49  
yeah, yeah. So there are two level. I see there are two levels of the sortability, one being the API resource or the config modification that user is providing, and the effect that config modification has on the eventual infra or event show or the cloud provider, right? Yeah, right.

Swarup Donepudi  9:14  
That's it. That's it. And we'll compute that will show, okay, I let okay. You have the history of history.

Suresh Attaluri  9:22  
History of history. You go, you can go through this, and we can highlight that every modification on plant and code is associated with a commit message, like, like GitHub. You

Swarup Donepudi  9:35  
can click on that to see in multiple Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  9:39  
So again, coming back to the video, can we just quickly discuss the steps? We present, the intent, the chart of modify, creating or modifying a DynamoDB. Creating a DynamoDB or just modifying the DynamoDB, you can start

Swarup Donepudi  9:56  
with, say, I would like to look up the configuration for an existing DynamoDB. And then I want to change the lock key from so and so so. So this is a known change that that is capturing more meaning. It definitely shows a diff in the infra. Also, I'm choosing the hash key rename, yeah, yeah. So

Suresh Attaluri  10:15  
we'll mention the intent of modifying it. Will modify it, and we'll jump from chart to the dashboard or the this thing Quick Search, where we search for that resource ID will open version history. We show the that there's a new commit that has been added, or version that has been added will go through the diff in Version History, and from Version History, we'll move to, we'll click on the stack Job Status icon that will move to, that will redirect us to a new page. There, we talk about the diff available in stack job blocks, and we show the difference that the provider

Swarup Donepudi  11:03  
end, yeah, so that will be the video. That will be the video. And here in this section, we'll simply show the screenshot of the big diff. And the pulumi diff has two screenshots. Okay, random image.

Suresh Attaluri  11:18  
What are those headings?

Swarup Donepudi  11:21  
Random stuff,

Suresh Attaluri  11:22  
and they can still be there

Swarup Donepudi  11:25  
complaints, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  11:28  
unified git diff format, yeah, we can show that diff.

Swarup Donepudi  11:31  
So here we have two screenshots. So maybe we'll show the chat part here, because the chat will also show unified diff, right? So we'll simply show that chat screen just from the recording where we demo we'll take a screenshot of that, or we'll take it later. But we are simply showing the video from the chat full chat context.

Suresh Attaluri  11:57  
We can add those lists right views of version history that's better stack job, list of stack jobs and list of versions better here, yeah, list of stack jobs and list of this thing will have a nice format

Swarup Donepudi  12:11  
here. We can show that you diff in to like both chat and the actual unified

Suresh Attaluri  12:19  
git di format for clarity. Yeah, that sounds good. Here we can put the pull images, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  12:28  
and audit trace wherever you are. I don't know if this is required, okay, we'll remove that. Real Time Tracking. We can remove this also stack jobs for every change is, again, is probably redundant. Oh, no, you highlighted this multiple times. Every configuration change,

Suresh Attaluri  12:53  
I think we have, we not this will be covered in that part,

Swarup Donepudi  13:00  
the things that I learned from GitHub and prompted chat GPT to say, yeah, it's okay to be returned the information in different places from different lenses. Yeah. Stack jobs here is in the context of visibility, like documenting deployment jobs, yeah. So here again, it's okay. We'll simply show again, stack jobs list. That's fine, yeah? But that's fine, as long as it's not wrong, right? Now, the goal is to make this, I think, just less wrong,

Suresh Attaluri  13:32  
yeah, putting the stack job list itself talks about it, right, like it has that nature of Russian history of Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  13:41  
for that, for these stack jobs history, we want to actually create a list of stack jobs for one of the resources. Instead of like creating something on that, yeah, they will just do a bunch of modifications and take screen that is far more easier than getting something on figma, right? Yes, empower your team and secure with developers and organizations again, as long as we don't need images, we will not make modifications here. So it's just okay interact through deployment changes tracking, yeah, we'll simply Yeah, even

Speaker 1  14:20  
disrespect you. I think

Swarup Donepudi  14:26  
I'll simply remove lead plant or your a power DevOps co pilot. Instead, we'll say interact through chat to make deployment changes and receive immediate tracking updates, including diff stack drop logs right within your conversation. And here are the benefits from for developer input, collaboration, Premier tools and organizations. I don't know what is here, but it is very similar to this kind of stuff. Yeah, for these, we are not touching them, as long as these are relevant. Like it says familiar to GitHub, it says enhanced transparency. So the icon, so these are things that it shall put with the relate. So collaboration is like multiple, yeah, stuff. So we'll leave those axes. And here also the images needed incident response and troubleshooting. So these are, like, use cases and scenarios as to why customary people. I think this is not the right one. I think he copied it from page, okay, helping new team members together in past changes. Okay, again, this is probably from chat GPT. He wrote it. And no media needed here, so we'll keep that, and that's the end of the page. Yeah? So short and sweet discussion. We knew that because we know we've done a lot of implementation here. So I think one of the takeaway from all these conversations is whenever we have good like working software, clearly built with purpose, we both understand that there is less discussion for things like service of which doesn't

Suresh Attaluri  15:55  
work, which even we don't have clarity

Swarup Donepudi  15:59  
or not on same page, like, for example, Kubernetes dashboard. You need to learn a lot. Ise workflows. Again, we are not, like, fully aligned on what is values, etc. Sorry. So we both not implemented, not aligned, so took a lot of time. So I think, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  16:20  
next big thing that we can close is those videos, the hero section videos, yeah, I believe we should target those that should be the base of our when we do the video, obviously we're going to, like, create a lot of stuff. Yeah, we'll have more action items,

Swarup Donepudi  16:43  
I think consistent resource IDs and stuff will name the resources suitable for demo purposes. Yes,

Suresh Attaluri  16:51  
yeah, okay, and we'll

Swarup Donepudi  16:52  
create a sample organization, and we will consistently use the same organization across Yeah, we'll ask chatgpt to give us a name that is suitable to use for all the demos.
