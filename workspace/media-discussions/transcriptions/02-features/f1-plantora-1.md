Swarup Donepudi  0:04  
All right, so again, the focus is to continue the discussions, and because we have already finished the landing page, now we are jumping on to the feature pages, and here we are going to first begin with plant aura AI, the world's first DevOps co pilot, and this is what we are trying to advertise it as. So I will navigate to that page on figma, and here it is, and I recall as considering a replacement for the current hero section title, which says transforms, transform DevOps with conversational AI. And we thought a better replacement could be platform engineer on duty 24/7 so Suresh, what do you think?

Speaker 1  1:07  
Yeah, transform DevOps with conversational. AI versus platform, engineer on

Swarup Donepudi  1:15  
duty, 24/7 on engineering, 24/7 platform,

Suresh Attaluri  1:18  
I don't know if that. I'm not sure which one should be it. But the other aspects platform engineering, 24/7, we want, we want to highlight that there is an assistant, a DevOps assistant for you, for your developer, that can answer certain things without manual intervention. That's the point, right?

Swarup Donepudi  1:45  
Yeah, but this is a sales website. So sales websites require catchy terms. Which one? Yeah, we will let chargeability determine. And one of the concerns you we both talked about to do that is we might probably like make it, make it ourselves. Difficult to sell platinum cloud to DevOps or platform engineering teams if we say that we have built their own alternative. But that's not the idea. So you need to be careful there. So if we put the section title as platform engineer on call 24/7 that can be better saying instead of saying on duty 24/7 we can say on call. 2747 on call is essentially like if you have a platform team, yeah, you usually have one guy, one of them as on call or helping the devs whenever they need. So we can say this plant or as platform engineer on call 20%

Suresh Attaluri  2:47  
so I think as a different you can still have the transform DevOps with conversational AI, okay, but

Swarup Donepudi  2:55  
the reason why I considered an alternative is this is very close to what we have on the main landing page as well. Conversational DevOps is the feature. So there is so much conversational, conversational that's very like, yeah, maybe something different.

Suresh Attaluri  3:11  
Okay, in that case, let's figure out the what do we call the Heading, Heading? But let's not mix the support part of it or the on call, on call benefit that user is going to get. Let's mention that as a subcategory or benefits that they are going to get from this feature. Let's look at the on call thing as a benefit. That on

Swarup Donepudi  3:40  
call is actually probably a bad term too, because when people say on call, that means they may assume that, oh, if something goes wrong in production for the application, then this guy is going to be there and fixing that stuff. So that might send a wrong message on to this on call is probably a bad on duty may also be a bad so, yeah, so maybe we can also simply say the world's first DevOps co pilot, as simple as that, right? I think that is better. That kind of tells what it is, and it doesn't lead any misconceptions like this is going to take care of any production outages automatically or anything. It's a DevOps co pilot.

Suresh Attaluri  4:22  
Can we see how GitHub is positioning their co pilot? I mean, how is there? Just for a reference,

Swarup Donepudi  4:29  
yeah, so github.com co pilot, so it says world's most widely adopted a developer

Suresh Attaluri  4:39  
two, a developer two, oh, yeah. Which is still up. The same sentence is still applicable for except

Swarup Donepudi  4:46  
most widely adopted. We'll say the words first. That's what I'm thinking. We are saying, right? DevOps co pilot, we can also add for developers, if needed. I. Um, or we can simply stick with the world's first DevOps co pilot. I think because it's also leading to from, from this, it says introducing plant, or the world's first DevOps co pilot, they come here plant, or maybe it should simply say the world's first DevOps co pilot. I think that's fine. We'll stick with that. I'll move on. Okay, and

Suresh Attaluri  5:23  
do we have this pattern? I see there are two things here on this section, like plant or AI. We are calling the feature. We are giving a name to that feature as plant or AI, and we are giving a single one punch line, one catch slime or one, I don't know. So that

Swarup Donepudi  5:40  
is what we are doing here. Okay, so everything

Suresh Attaluri  5:43  
has a name, and this is also

Swarup Donepudi  5:47  
inspired from our source, which is GitHub. Okay, everything has a title and but this is not again here, so the punch line will not be here, but, yeah, we do have those punch lines everywhere, and they have titles. But the hero section we have, yeah, this is only for menu part, yeah. So, so, going back to the plantora page, the section, Hero section title will be modified to say the world's first DevOps co pilot will keep the subsection as is and or maybe we can update this to probably say something more meaningful, which is the this is called, I think subs hero section tagline or something. So right now it says, meet plant aura, your AI power DevOps co pilot for simplified, efficient and infrastructure intuitive infrastructure management, we can probably come up with something more meaningful there.

Suresh Attaluri  6:53  
Also, I think we had a short discussion earlier. How about branding this plant, or as, I don't know how, as plant and co pilot, or like, how GitHub is doing, or co pilot GitHub, or co pilot, plant and co pilot, plant and co pilot, just,

Swarup Donepudi  7:17  
yeah, simple thought, Yeah, we didn't build so much material around plantora in the app, in on the website. So at this point, I'm just like slightly hesitating because it might push out. And also, I'm not finding that as a huge improvement over plant or itself. I

Suresh Attaluri  7:44  
think even planter sounds well, the only thing that we discussed is plant. Or by saying plant or we need to explain it to people that it's a co pilot. Yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  7:57  
anybody who comes here, right, nobody is going to learn about plantora Outside Plant and cloud, okay, until, unless they are on the sales website, they won't see plant or for sure, because we are nobody in the market, right, okay? And we are putting so much around plantora to clearly communicate that it is a COVID, okay, so it people don't have to understand that feature by its name, we are putting sufficient sales material around it to make it very easy for people to understand that. In fact, we did. We overdid it to a point where we see a lot of places where it says plant, Oracle, pilot, plant or a plant or co pilot. That's not a risk. So as for the tagline itself, it says, meet plan Dora, your AI port, DevOps co pilot for simplified, efficient and so instead of this, can we put a liner that helps any visitor clearly understand what it is, what is the problem that it is set to solve, right? Like, for example, when, when I'm using plantora, or this chat chat bot on a day to day basis, which I am, for example, I was trying to create a necessary bucket and a DynamoDB table to set up TerraForm state backend for for test purposes. And in the past, I used to begin by thinking or Googling, hey, how do I do that? Blah, blah, blah. Instead, I simply asked in the chat conversation I am creating because I want to use it for this thing and plant or the chat or the bot, requested me to provide a name, and I think the environment the plant term cloud environment. So I gave it both, and it used that context to construct the version message saying creating an x3 bucket to be used as TerraForm state backend and the plumie stack. Back ran and the s3 bucket got created in AWS account, and I followed it up with creating the DynamoDB table. So this is the first time I experienced something that I've never seen before. I don't know if there are other places where I get the same experience, but with simple chat conversation, I was able to create both history bucket and a DynamoDB table, and I was able to instantly use those as my TerraForm straight backend, and it all worked, right? So the point I'm trying to make is, as a developer, or even an ops engineer, I have experienced for the first time, being able to provision cloud infrastructure with cons, with simple conversation, where I was asked some information that I can provide, and the rest was, was figured out by plan Dora, and it made the necessary API calls to plant on cloud. So I didn't really have to learn about anything about plant and cloud in this process, except for, oh, I need an environment to do the whole thing, right? So how can we represent that simplicity in in and utilize this space to provide a more clear, meaningful stuff? Okay,

Speaker 1  11:18  
I don't know the purpose of the line. I mean, I don't have any.

Swarup Donepudi  11:23  
You can wear the hat of the visitor of the website and see, oh, you visited the website just now, and you see the world's first DevOps co pilot, yeah, what would, can you like imagine what could have been a better line here that? So I'm

Suresh Attaluri  11:41  
thinking, I would, I would expect leading the reading that third line like a feature name, a short description, and then this again, a description about the feature, the third level of second level of discrete describing that feature. I would like to know what does, what does it does, or how can I use it, right, like when at a high level and and whatever you told about how you used it, I see plantora providing this guided experience, okay, at a single spot, a single place, which is a charge to create a provisional infrastructure, right?

Swarup Donepudi  12:31  
So maybe, maybe just thinking about it right now, even like going back to my own experience of using plant and cloud, I think I actually probably want, or wanted to emphasize on the fact that I didn't need to learn plant on Cloud to use plant on Cloud to do that stuff, just because there is plan like plant aura, right? If this is not the case, what would have been my alternate method is either open like do Command K, navigate to quick actions, say, deploy s3 bucket, or create s3 bucket and look at the form. Use this in text, information, right? And then go to DynamoDB, create form, fill out that information versus this

Suresh Attaluri  13:22  
plan, plan to raise removing that necessity of understanding. Plant and cloud platform, also the providers platform, like, what are the inputs that a user need to give to create an s3 bucket? So the provider platform, that's some learning that users need to do at the provider end and also at the plant and cloud end, right? But here we are saying you will get a guided experience. To me, something random biggest

Swarup Donepudi  13:57  
benefit, right? That's meaning eliminating the need for the users to learn plant on Cloud, to use plant on Cloud is what plant aura enables first, and also like, yeah, plant down cloud, in a way, already abstracts away the cloud providers. Plant download itself, even without the chat ops part, yeah, we are kind of not requesting the user to learn about any configuration that is needed by the cloud provider. We are already like documenting it via help text and field names and all that. However, in order to use leverage that abstraction, the users first need to understand how to use plankton flow, yeah, meaning they need to learn that, hey, in order to create any deployment, you need to use quick actions or do some search to get to the form. Fill out the form, click Submit, and then you will be shown the stack, job progress and stuff, whereas, without navigating the interface of client conclude itself. I just use chat, I provision two resources. So I So again, I'm feeling I'm explicitly calling out all of this information for chat, chat GPT to understand and synthesize all of this information. To give us those two liner punch line for the hero section, which contains the title of DevOp, or the world's first DevOps co pilot, and we both talked about the most important value that it provides users is the obviating the need to learn new interfaces or new systems and just get their stuff done with without that learning curve.

Suresh Attaluri  15:39  
And with our conversation, the theme of this section is, how is how is it helping users? I believe that's what the theme for this section

Swarup Donepudi  15:55  
would be, right? You mean the hero section, that

Suresh Attaluri  15:59  
the tagline thing we are talking about, yeah, the Hero Session has a name. Then what what we call these three sections? Man,

Swarup Donepudi  16:16  
Hero section is this section every web page now what we call this will be the hero section title, this one that is a feature name. Yeah. Ignore this. Ignore this. We are on already on the feature page. We are never talking about this. This is just a way for users to know where they are on the website. Yes, legal address and Okay, so you won't use this highlighter. I Okay,

so you have long press, hold and then start moving.

Suresh Attaluri  16:54  
Okay, so this one is title, title of the feature, and this one, we are calling it as tagline, tagline.

Swarup Donepudi  17:02  
We can also simply call it subtitling. That's more easier, I guess,

Suresh Attaluri  17:06  
title and subtitle, yeah. So the theme of hero section, theme of title would be explaining what it's

Swarup Donepudi  17:17  
more of inclined towards sales friendly, meaning something fancier, yeah, fancier. But also kind of conveys what it is. So it's like there is a subtle difference there, yeah, but it is. It's important to be sales friendly, more elevated title to create some excitement, etc, yeah. And

Suresh Attaluri  17:38  
theme of subtitle is, what is the value that this feature is will give to users? Yeah, more or less a small description, yeah. And in case of plant Dora now,

Swarup Donepudi  17:50  
yeah. And also it's it's not necessary that whatever we have currently is also created by chat repeat itself on all the conversation, so we don't have to replace it. Just for the sake of replacing it, we are just having this conversation to see if that we can do anything better, or if whatever we already have can can be a good subtitle already. So yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  18:16  
so the current subtitle is your AI powered for simplified, efficient and intuitive infrastructure management. In case of intuitive, the only word that I can think of is a guided Yeah, I'm open for chat, GPT to put more this thing. Okay, I don't know how, but yeah, that's all it

Swarup Donepudi  18:41  
is, yeah, so I think it can use some improvement. So yeah, we'll now let's move on to the watch video section, right? So we said we wanted to a we can either put the video right below, or we can leave it to watch video section. Or we can have the video here instead, instead of this, this thing, animation or illustration, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  19:12  
I'm brought to having video at the top that the hero section, only some part of it being

Swarup Donepudi  19:17  
shown. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:20  
I don't know, what do you think? Let's

Swarup Donepudi  19:23  
always refer to what we've always done. So yeah, I think even here, it's the same thing hero section, and a hint that if you scroll down, there is more, there is you can watch. So you're in our section, we will ask if shot to do the same thing, which is the hero section should be shown, and let the users know that there is a section right below which they can get to by scrolling up. And that should be the we. View itself. So now going back to the plantora page. Yeah, maybe some of this can be adjusted to make it probably slightly useless space here, and move this guy maybe to the right or somewhere. I don't know. I will. We should not be the ones designing it. We let us share know that the users should get a hint that they can scroll up to get more content. Yes, all right, so now, okay, that's great, but what should be the content of the video itself

Speaker 1  20:43  
is the script is what we're talking about. We don't

Swarup Donepudi  20:48  
have to think of script as a script, because that kind of might throw us away. You just have to, like, what's the purpose of this video in the first place is we want to use two to three minutes to show the best part of plant Ara or this feature. Yeah, right. And maybe you can begin what? What, according to you, is some you don't have to think about script. You just script. You just have to tell me if you were demonstrating plan Torah to a potential future customer or any, anyone who you think can benefit from it, what would be your choice of actions that you would do on plantora or on the platform entirely to demonstrate those capabilities. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  21:53  
like what we discussed, you know, yeah, the same will go through the developers journey. Only need a developer trying to build a Java back end service, and I want, or there is an existing back end service, Java back end service we

Swarup Donepudi  22:22  
can begin with. Begin with bootstrapping. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  22:24  
I mean, the our whole platform has this Bootstrap,

Swarup Donepudi  22:28  
the train right through Bootstrap, Bootstrap

Suresh Attaluri  22:32  
and all those things. But the reason I'm not mentioning those because the right now they are not in November state. So let's first. Figure out the provision part, the journey of provision part. And then, if we can calculate that, then we'll go.

Swarup Donepudi  22:49  
Once we have the bootstrapping and cacd part ready, service of functionality building, we will update the video. Update

Suresh Attaluri  22:57  
The video will start from this thing apart. But let's say, meet a developer in an organization. I have access to plant and cloud, and I already have a service running now I want to deploy now. I want a new infrastructure called Redis. I want to set up a Redis instance for my service to implement a new feature, implement a feature in our product. So the first thing that I'll I'll be doing is I'll come to, I don't know if we have to establish the problem, but how it is.

Swarup Donepudi  23:47  
Or, I think important part here is we can make a few assumptions. And let's imagine we are watching a lot of videos on YouTube too, right? Every time somebody shows us something, they don't begin from the actual origins, right? Okay, they kind of get to the beat of it right away. Like, for example, we have been watching land chain videos, right? They don't say, hey, here is how you set a plan, chain framework, SDK, blah, blah, blah, okay. They just get to the point, which is, okay.

Suresh Attaluri  24:16  
My point is, do we need to establish the problem and then show them the before and after. Should the videos? Theme will look like that? Or we can just jump in?

Swarup Donepudi  24:28  
Yeah, I think again, most people do understand. So again, the theme, the part of the what is that we are trying to convey here on this particular page is the conversational capabilities, not like the whole problem. And when you have services, you would need database. So when you need database, you can come here. All of that is not necessary, okay, we can that can be as simple as saying, Hey, I'm pretty sure most of the services. Is need some kind of databases, or some other open source software or some cloud infrastructure. So as a developer, how this is how you can leverage the DevOps co pilot, and you can start it, you can jump right into it, instead of like setting up the setting that's all waste of time and not a lot of value on this particular page. Video, okay, so the script begins with saying, let's imagine your service requires a Redis Database, as simple as that, yeah, and you're using Google. It is and so

Suresh Attaluri  25:33  
I don't see any we can directly jump into the product and show the product. Yeah? Saying this is our plant or interface. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  25:41  
you don't even have to mention those words, yeah. So the key I learned is don't waste your time and script vocabulary with saying mention obvious things. Okay, when you are already there, people know that that is your plan. Dora interface, right? Okay, so key aspect of sales content is get to the most important part as soon as possible. If that seems interesting, people will figure out the rest, meaning they will invest their energy to actually learn about how to sign up, how to navigate. So we will use, just like an quick introduction to say, if you need any cloud infrastructure or open source, here is how you can do it first. Let's imagine your service needs a Redis Database without having spending any money. You can do it on Kubernetes. So let me show you how to do that right. And you can notice that user actions the intent in a chart, and you can see that the guided conversation is requesting you to provide this information, and I am providing this information, and as soon as I did, the bot responds with the may deploy. It's deployed. And,

Speaker 1  27:01  
yeah, we don't know. We need to highlight that.

Swarup Donepudi  27:04  
We want to highlight we want to highlight that. And we also want to also show that. Notice that, as well as the stack job is created, and you created this from this thing on second half of the screen, you should refresh the dashboard and show that. Notice that as new stack job is running, you created it. And here is the resource detail of the etc, etc. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  27:26  
we jump from Stack chat to the stack job. We will

Swarup Donepudi  27:29  
have both. We'll have two half screens, okay, where one is the plant over chat, and the second half is the dashboard itself, where we are showing the chat at the same time we are showing that also,

Suresh Attaluri  27:45  
yeah, we can eliminate that. And how about we? I mean, another way of demoing it. How about instead of choosing a Kubernetes resource, we choose AWS Exactly.

Swarup Donepudi  27:55  
Instead of wasting time there, we want to show that it's a multi cloud any it's very easy for people to automate Kubernetes. Kubernetes has, like lots of tooling around it. Help. Chats are very easy way. So people might brush your technology stack off simply assuming that we are running a health chart behind the scenes. So we want to demonstrate multi cloud aspect of current on cloud by saying, let's imagine now you need a storage bucket.

Suresh Attaluri  28:27  
Storage Bucket, yeah, and we provide that intent on the chart, yeah. So our radio starts. In

Swarup Donepudi  28:33  
fact, instead of s3 bucket, we can also do a DynamoDB, because that is also quick, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  28:38  
and yeah. And we show this nice comparison, that here the stack job is has started, and here the resources are, yeah, and we can do the same thing for the GCP also, yeah. I believe Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  28:53  
It's not Yeah. We can simply say it's not very common to see organizations using multiple clouds, but it's there for you if you need it. So let's, let's say I now want to deploy, create a new GC storage bucket on Google Cloud, instead of s3 bucket. So I say I need an GCS bucket, it, transfer it, and we open Google Cloud, and there is that. And then maybe, as a conclusion, at the end, at the very end, we can say, so all of what we have done in the chat is now there 14 to like see, will go to Canvas, will show the resources have not created. And we

Speaker 1  29:38  
will then, I don't know if we have to move from the chart,

Swarup Donepudi  29:42  
yeah, we

Unknown Speaker  29:46  
will have

Swarup Donepudi  29:48  
other automation. Is where that needs to be emphasized, right? So I think, yeah, we should not show everything in every video. Yeah, let's keep it. Short, keep it short and demonstrate the capabilities of conversational power, guided resource creation, embedded stack jobs,

Suresh Attaluri  30:10  
ability to request something and ability to see the effect. So that's what we need to convey in this video. And

Swarup Donepudi  30:19  
then when it comes to I was also tempted to say that this automation that you are seeing is actually a open source and all that, but I think that should be saved for integrated IISC workflows part. Maybe there also we will begin with saying I want to deploy this. But where is this IISC coming from? That is where, that is the page where we should talk about it, which is project plan, done open source. Here is the plumie module code. This is where it is running. All these are available

Unknown Speaker  30:49  
as a framework. We need to, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  30:51  
that IAC workflows page is not on plant or page, plant or a page. We need to make sure we are disciplined enough to only we

Suresh Attaluri  31:00  
along with AWS and GCP, we also demonstrate the Kubernetes part as a third one, like we can still do that. I

Swarup Donepudi  31:09  
thought the first one itself is Kubernetes. You want to begin with AWS

Suresh Attaluri  31:13  
that is more, that is more AWS

Swarup Donepudi  31:15  
or GCP, that those three three, because we will edit the video. Also, we will cut down here with the name the bot takes

Unknown Speaker  31:24  
the stack, job, exhibition time. We can

Swarup Donepudi  31:28  
cut every we will only include the step. Response will be quick. We'll say we are like, moving. We won't even say, like, that's what that is. Where we need to be we need to avoid temptations that we will need to educate user about everything that is happening, that we are editing and we are cutting down time. All of that is not necessary. People are smart enough to understand what's going on, and we want to utilize those two to three minutes to get their attention, to demonstrate the core capabilities of that feature page. I think right now we have a good, finalized, scoped out script where we begin with I want, let's imagine your service would need a DynamoDB table. So this is how, hey, plant Ara, I need DynamoDB table for my service, and we'll provide the inputs. We get a DynamoDB table. We open AWS console right at both times. Just before we start the conversation, we show the we have the AWS DynamoDB table service page right there. We'll say that I don't have any I want to create. And you say, create. It creates. We refresh. Here is an NGO DB table. And then we can say, hey, I also need a GCS bucket. We'll go to Google Cloud Storage bucket and say, refresh, and there is nothing, and I create something. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  32:52  
as a demo, we only show the positive

Swarup Donepudi  32:54  
flow of it. We are not going to

Suresh Attaluri  32:57  
like, enter the wrong input and then see how it reacts, and also, and then we say, simple, my

Swarup Donepudi  33:03  
service also requires a Redis Cache, so we'll deploy that. And at the end, we'll also say, oh, I want, I want to set the CPU limits for my Redis or memory limits for my Redis Cache, to do it twice, double. So the final part of the screen script is to say, I want to double the Redis memory, yeah, and then it shows the unified div. And

Unknown Speaker  33:31  
now you're talking about another intent, right?

Swarup Donepudi  33:34  
Okay, not intent. It's still the capabilities of planter only,

Suresh Attaluri  33:38  
yeah, planter only. But okay, you apart from creating, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  33:45  
it's not Hello worlds, yeah. So advanced enough to we

Speaker 1  33:48  
try out three multi cloud, multi cloud part. No, we have

Swarup Donepudi  33:54  
the creation part. You can create resources and create multi cloud resources and then

Speaker 1  33:59  
finally update them as well. That's what you want to

Swarup Donepudi  34:03  
and let's see if, if the script gives us sufficient time, and all of this has, I think we squeezed into two to three minutes. Yeah, let's

Suresh Attaluri  34:10  
first try do the Create part. That's for sure. We are going to do it. We'll see how it comes out. Is it too long, too short. Yeah, too much.

Swarup Donepudi  34:25  
As part of the script, we will do all three, which is create, update, okay, yeah, yeah. If we think that we are going beyond the Create part, extending the script for long,

Suresh Attaluri  34:36  
yeah, that's how we can do. We should not jump to a new provider, yeah, if you want to demonstrate update, then that's, I think that's more we keep it along with create like we have created it now we want to modify

Swarup Donepudi  34:47  
it, yeah, and yeah. So that's, that's good, okay, moving beyond. This is the first section says, challenge, navigating complex DevOps landscape. Developers often grapple with, integrate interfaces, endless documentation and stream learning curves just to perform routine DevOps. Each tool comes with this. Been talking about, I think I am happy with this. The challenge, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  35:13  
getting complex DevOps landscape. That's what we discussed when chatgpt came

Swarup Donepudi  35:19  
up with these titles and descriptions. Description based on these historical conversations. And

Suresh Attaluri  35:26  
what is, I think we need to figure out the image here, right?

Swarup Donepudi  35:29  
Isn't it? I think that's okay our or we can use the menus. It is a

Unknown Speaker  35:35  
relevant image. This is from irrelevant.

Swarup Donepudi  35:39  
If we want to do any better, we can show menus and we

Suresh Attaluri  35:44  
can have the same GIF which which we are planning to have it on the home screen, the actual this thing. So with this script, we decided that will, once we are done with the video, we'll come up with a GIF, or

Swarup Donepudi  35:59  
maybe, right? So, yeah, I'm just slightly more a little more hesitant in overburdening ourselves. Well, complicated this thing, like, for example, as soon as you say this, if this is not relevant, we will write, okay, okay. Like, for example, when you see repetitive stuff, right? This one and this one, okay, maybe might make sense here, but there is, this is used in lot of places, so it does not make sense. So that is the areas where we are going to work on to get what is right. For example, this one right kind of appropriate. So we live with that, so that, because we have so much work to do, we go beyond and we like do the entire journey and come back and be like, let's probably make improvements.

Suresh Attaluri  36:44  
What are these points? I mean, I know hero section videos, yeah, and then

Swarup Donepudi  36:52  
sections is what I refer to during my conversations with chat GPT, every page will have hero section. Page sections. But I consistently used that term to say I give me a hero. Is also called Hero element sometimes, and then give me page sections.

Suresh Attaluri  37:14  
Page sections, the theme of page sections, of challenges, I think,

Swarup Donepudi  37:20  
page section so my approach when I was doing this is hrgpt. I'm going to tell you all about this. Okay, give me hirovite. Give me six page sections. Six page okay, with the title for each of the page section and some description or subtitle for that section.

Unknown Speaker  37:42  
Okay, the same thing what we did for the I told you

Swarup Donepudi  37:45  
that it has to all of those sections combined, starting from Hero element to the end of the page. Sure, tell a cohesive story and cover all the aspects of what, whatever I already explained, right? So these, I didn't tell it that the first one should be a challenge. So it came up with so

Suresh Attaluri  38:06  
it is trying to establish the problem. Yeah, we talked about feature. Now it is trying to create, have a structure that what is the problem?

Swarup Donepudi  38:13  
This is not by me. It's all I only kind of reviewed what it gave at the end and whenever I was, like, satisfied and like, moved on, perfect. And the

Suresh Attaluri  38:26  
other one is the solution, I believe, yeah, the first part is challenge, and this part is the solution. Like plan, we say that plantar is the solution to handle that complexity, and then guided resource.

Swarup Donepudi  38:42  
So here easy. So this one says, right, I think this is good. We move on. This one is not because it says guided resource creation made easy. We will add a GIF. Here. We say, I want to deploy something, and it prompts for you, we give input, and

Suresh Attaluri  39:03  
to show how it is guided, you need to show the problem. Recently,

Swarup Donepudi  39:08  
I did Dynamo degree, and I think that's a great example, where it said, Give me name environment. And that's like slightly more input, but not too much. So I gave it, okay, here is the name and environment, and then prompted for give me the hash key name and key variant. I told it like lock ID and S should be it, and it gave so I think that will be a good shift shot, and it will include everything. Yes, I think that's good. And real time deployment progress in chat. So this one is same.

Suresh Attaluri  39:47  
The chart will show the chart from confirm, like, Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  39:52  
I think the GIF will begin with all of the previous screenshot. Screenshot, yeah, and. Begin with user entering

Suresh Attaluri  40:01  
confirming to create the confirming the import that user has provided,

Swarup Donepudi  40:08  
and then Stackdriver is shown will be triggered

Suresh Attaluri  40:11  
and the touching the GIF would be so basically, what we are doing is we are trying to break down the video content

Swarup Donepudi  40:17  
into smaller changes. What

Suresh Attaluri  40:21  
So, how about this part? So here we just Okay, here we just show that the starting point, right? Yeah, yeah, real time, deployment, progress,

Swarup Donepudi  40:36  
and we will show the full, full progress, not just like started. We'll show the whole thing. Yeah, we'll see. And then this is, this is a more, bigger area to show, a better this thing. So if we want to show a bigger image, full image of chat window versus just this one cannot include a bigger image, I guess. So. This is a place to do more images. That's all we can remove it. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  41:17  
yeah. Simplified permission, again. What is that? Simplified permission and access management. Oh, so

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
this is, I think I am trying to add there, I told you, right? So I'm asking I'm adding to the board for the stuff that we are claiming on the website to create content. So I think we didn't do anything here, like the either environment this thing or granting a team member a role is, is? Is what this was meant for. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  41:50  
we'll get to that. So basically, till now, we have already discussed provisioning. Part of provisioning has this is not a simple task. It has this guided experience thing. It has this benefit of stack job initiation and all those things. So that's when it got spilled over or split into these two parts. But simplified permission and access management is straightforward, straight forward, and

Swarup Donepudi  42:25  
we are also trying to break off the maybe, maybe we might be creating an impression. Candora can only do DevOps automation, but instead we are like saying that no ask for stuff outside the automation and plant over. Can help you.

Suresh Attaluri  42:46  
But is it okay? The initially we DevOps co pilot, and then when I go down, I was surprised. Oh, can you do this? I mean, as a user again,

Swarup Donepudi  42:57  
we don't have to do perfectionist there? Yeah, we think that's fine, as long as we want to demonstrate all of the capabilities we have built. And if the places where we are talking about those are not the most appropriate places, I'm saying that's okay. And same thing with seamless credential and connection sharing. And here I want to actually do a video,

Suresh Attaluri  43:25  
seamless credential and connection sharing. Okay, yeah, I am going to do

Swarup Donepudi  43:29  
a video, and I'm going to tell you the script right now, okay, and I'm going to first begin with my explaining on iPad. I love platform engineers. I love AWS icon, and I have developers. This is my first initial beginning of the iPad screen recording. And these platform engineers and developers will be like animated photos, like there is a icon store. I'm going to get a group of people and call them platform engineers, a group of people called developers, and there will be Google Cloud AWS and maybe Google Analytics cluster. So I'm going to begin by explaining the fact that these developers want to deploy resources to these AWS or Kubernetes or GCS account and platform engineers do have access to these directly, but those don't. So platform engineers will connect these to platinum cloud, and they will only allow the environments that need access to deploy, and the way to do that can be via plantora, and now I'm going to go to plantora, and as a platform engineer, I'm going to grant access for one of the environments to deploy to this. But using this command called hey, I want to share so and so credential and. And I will end it there, meaning I'm not going to prove that the credential has been shared. Blah, blah, blah. I'm going to emphasize on the fact that you can share, or you can this is how

Unknown Speaker  45:13  
plan you will get a response, yeah, I

Swarup Donepudi  45:15  
share. You share. Now developers who have access to this environment can proceed deploying to this AWS account because the platform engineer authorized them to do so, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  45:27  
so I see there are multiple video content, as when we talk about media on this page, I see two types of it. One is cloud video content and then for small contents which have G for screenshots, yeah. What do you think if we we decided that we will have one video at the top right instead of one video, how about we break it? Break these videos into smaller videos, like provisioning will be a video and granting access. Oh,

Swarup Donepudi  46:06  
so just make the landing page where there is buttons, buttons below. I think the more videos, the better. More videos

Suresh Attaluri  46:14  
in smaller more smaller videos is much better. However, let's Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  46:21  
let's, yeah, that's good.

Suresh Attaluri  46:28  
That's that's actually better to even begin. And we can in these subsections or page content. That's what we are calling it. We there. We can have a smaller form of media, which is a GIF for a screenshot. Yeah, so we tell most of our story at the top.

Swarup Donepudi  46:46  
That's better. So even for deciding on what be those smaller store videos, we should actually rely on these things only.

Suresh Attaluri  46:55  
Yeah, the sections you will learn anything new from the below page content. It's just a screenshot of, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  47:04  
no, even, even first to determine watch how many videos we want, we are going to rely on this content like first take, for example. For this one, will not have a separate video altogether. We'll move on, but guided resource creation. We'll say, we'll have one video just for guided resource creation.

Suresh Attaluri  47:26  
Yeah, this, this thing comes for all the three, right? Like boots,

Swarup Donepudi  47:34  
yeah, we can say, No, we should not combine, though, that's what I'm saying. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  47:39  
bootstrap will have a video, yeah, but Bootstrap has the ability of this guided resource creation, and also it has this real time deployment routers, yeah, so, so

Swarup Donepudi  47:50  
there, it should not be a one to one map, one to one map. That's what we can say. Bootstrap services, provision, infrastructure, provision infrastructure and access management,

Suresh Attaluri  48:01  
yeah, Access Manager three, and also what is the other one will build will might

Swarup Donepudi  48:10  
eventually come, and then maybe auditable intelligence and team transparency, saying whatever you are creating from the chat interface, it is transparent for the entire team. So that's one thing.

Suresh Attaluri  48:25  
This has to be here. We already have a section for it, right?

Swarup Donepudi  48:30  
Yeah, I think we will skip that part. Yeah, that's good. I think we don't want to put more concepts. Yeah, overall, we are not going to add and if at all is needed, we will put a screenshot of that credential sharing, video recording, chat window, whatever we show there, we'll put the final screenshot of the chat conversation as an image here, for simplicity, yeah. As for the video itself. The content is already explained in the video with titles.

Suresh Attaluri  49:05  
I think for chart, we can choose GIFs that would be better than screenshot the person entering something. The gifs also

Swarup Donepudi  49:15  
would require script, and we are not going to reinvent the script. We are going to reinvent the script. We are going to take the GIFs from the video itself. Yeah, okay, and we identified that the videos would be provision, cloud infrastructure, access management. I think Bootstrap is something that when we have

Suresh Attaluri  49:39  
but for now, there are two things that I'm looking at. One is for provision, and other,

Swarup Donepudi  49:43  
access management. That's it. We will not try. The key to success here is to not overburden ourselves with creating content because we lack experience there, and the more we commit to create. Creating the higher chance that we will fail. Yes. So I think whatever we discussed so far are still within the realm of our own skill set and tools that we have to achieve what is necessary. Just to conclude. So this one is good image. We are not going to touch this. This one will have a GIF. The Guided resource creation part will be a GIF, yeah. So this one the so the guided resource creation part will have a GIF cut from the same video recording, cut from the video recording, yeah, where we are going to show DynamoDB guided resource part. That's it now, scrolling up, so you can scroll up from here by pressing so, yeah, we as we scroll up the real time deployment Progress, also from the provisioning part, we are going to do a GIF. Yes, okay, and this, I think

Unknown Speaker  51:03  
we might have this thing right. I

Swarup Donepudi  51:08  
think more next page. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  51:10  
so when we include bootstrapping and all, like I was saying, the real, real time deployment progress and guided resources are more suitable for provisioning. We'll keep it like that, yeah, even though the chart naturally or has that feature of guided experience, we choose provision part of our platform to demonstrate

Swarup Donepudi  51:35  
the guided part. And then probably this part will be removed, yes, and we will replace it with, eventually, there is going to be more content in the form of bootstrapping and maybe operating etc, we'll add them. So for now, we'll remove this section, which is an empty Image section showing plant or a chat box. And even if it is there, we can probably show some other chat screenshot that's that's also way,

Unknown Speaker  52:02  
yeah, if I don't know

Swarup Donepudi  52:04  
the importance of this, I don't know design perspective, oh, sometimes what happens is, if you have a continuous series of these boxes, okay, it's like a cluttered space, okay, so introducing some space in here makes it less

Suresh Attaluri  52:20  
cluttered. It's something that is shot, yeah, so coming up, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  52:24  
And then simplified permission, my action management will also be a GIF cut from the video. So overall, the content on plant aura will be two videos, one showing provision, one showing access management. And we'll take GIFs from those videos to create the media for the rest of the page and for the these empty images, you still use a large screenshot. That's it. For the chat itself, showing something else, right we have. We can tell a different stories. It doesn't have to be related to this or the above stuff. It can simply be some random conversation in the chat that does something useful. Like, what can I think of is, for example, today I had an interesting conversation with plant. Or

Suresh Attaluri  53:13  
how would we show the combined conversation? Like, here we said that we'll have a GIF, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  53:19  
Or what I'm thinking is that larger area can be leveraged to show screenshots of smaller conversations. Okay, multiple resources, yeah, I wonder

Suresh Attaluri  53:33  
which we see blah, blah, so that should at the top we are saying you will have these guided experience and and real time charts, yeah, but you can have it for those

Swarup Donepudi  53:48  
are, like, just collage of various chats, yeah, lots of information saying, hey, I want to update, add a new DNS record, right today, I had an interesting conversation. I can show it to you, which I was, like, impressed, like I told, I said, I went to the GCP DNS zone. Okay, it's resource chat, okay. Oh, I we never talked about, oh, I think the plant over page needs to be updated with these new, two new features, which is, you can share chats with your team members. You have the chats co located alongside your resources. I'm kind of tired right now. It's a 54 minute conversation, but we will just have a brief conversation about the

Suresh Attaluri  54:35  
how we can position this part of it like it is still chat, but it is, it is next to your resources. You can just start, and

Swarup Donepudi  54:49  
your team is collaborating on that resource with you. Yeah, the chat is free of that particular deployment. Deployed resource is the. And your team is collaborating. Somebody comes into does something, somebody else comes in. So that's, that's the highlight, which is collaborate discussion. Will have one discussion where we dedicatedly talk about the APA resource chats, the importance of them, and the team collaboration aspect there, and locating the configuration right alongside and the bot will already know that you are talking about the it knows the context because it is right, and the shared chats where you can collaborate with your team on random aspects. So I think those two will be added as two separate sections on the plant aura Features page. Yes. Okay. Now I was talking about this interesting feature, right? So I said I wanted to update the configuration. Yeah, as well. I want to update the third record of the MX record to change it from one to eight, okay. I want to change the third value of MX record to replace with one to eight, okay. And it did give me, gave me the unified F. And I said, Yeah, but before proceeding, can you show me the full updated state? And it showed me the right value, okay, so yeah, this is, like, I felt very good because of, yeah. These are, like, not easy, and the fact that, and we didn't build for this, right? We didn't write any conditional to say if it is a list, and I was able to figure out smartly. So this has lots and lots of value, I felt. So, yeah, concluding, we will continue the discussion to discuss about those two. We'll have another discussion. I think we talked about everything else on the page, so that's a good discussion. Any closing remarks? No, can you stop i.
