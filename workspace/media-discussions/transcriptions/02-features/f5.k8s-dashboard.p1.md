Swarup Donepudi  0:21  
Okay, I moved the camera. But because you want to be covered. The camera is here

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
should come this. So, okay,

Swarup Donepudi  0:57  
okay, cool, all right, so let's begin the discussion. We have time boxed into 20 minutes, and the goal is to finish one of the next feature. We already finished our plan to app so we'll move on to self service DevOps. What do you think we can cover in 20 minutes? I

Suresh Attaluri  1:15  
think self service jobs is a bigger feature to a topic. I think Kubernetes dashboard is smaller,

Swarup Donepudi  1:24  
okay, all right, so the hero section here says secure and simplified Kubernetes access. And the goal here is, why did we build the Kubernetes dashboard is there are a lot of Kubernetes dashboard applications like dedicated so they have extensive support for every single feature available on Kubernetes. But that is not the goal for us to build this feature into our own product. The goal is to build an application or service centric view into Kubernetes and any operations that the service owners need to perform, we are trying to simplify it for them, meaning those the dashboards that typically exist outside may are still totally relevant. We don't recommend replacing those with this solution, but we are, because we are an internal developer platform which focuses on developer experience, starting from bootstrapping all the way to day two, plus operations, that is post deployment operations, obviously, devs would need a few tools to interact with their services, whether they are in lower environments like dev or staging or even in production. And me being a platform engineer or a Kubernetes engineer, for a long time, I have seen this use case across many companies. While there is a lot that Kubernetes can offer via dashboards, there is a few set of actions that most of the developers rely on in order to efficiently troubleshoot or do any type of post deployment operations with their services. So we I, because I have experience, and I kind of identified those set of core, core set of tools and functions needed for developers on Kubernetes, we built just that. Okay, so again, reiterating the fact that this is not a full blown Kubernetes dashboard. This is only a minified but effective doing the most frequently used actions only with that. Yeah, go on.

Suresh Attaluri  3:40  
So I think you covered most of it, but looking in the context of a website, feature page, yeah, we have these two things, right, title and subtitle, yes, that's what we need to figure it out. Title, it says secure and simplified Kubernetes access. The theme of our titles is catchy line to

Suresh Attaluri  4:05  
offer feature, yeah. So I think that's already yeah serves a purpose. I

Swarup Donepudi  4:10  
think again I get I did the same type of exercise with the rich, and took all the transcription and provided it to chatgpt, and I explained the whole thing, and it gave a set of subtitles. And we have like, three different alternatives. I finalized this one, so we have two more. We can take a look at them. But since we both are on agreement that this is a reasonable and stuff. So yeah, I also Yeah, I want to highlight what those top five, top few, Kubernetes tools before that. Do you have anything to say?

Suresh Attaluri  4:49  
Yeah, same point like subtitle. Case again, the theme of subtitle is to tell what users can do with this feature, right So, and now it's a streamline your day to operations and accelerate development with plant and cloud. Yeah, which is still okay, reasonable, but we are okay if planned and chatgpt gives us any other suggestions, and to do that, I believe we can give more context of what are those operations? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  5:22  
I just that also crossed my mind to instead of hiding those, saving them for the later sections of the page, maybe the subtitle is a good place to simply highlight what those five or six different things, because those are not a lot. And just like for example, instead of saying streamline your day to operations at accelerate development with plant on cloud, that doesn't really provide a lot of value, there, maybe streamline your day to Ops is good, but the rest of is like in sales messaging. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  5:57  
I don't know if day two operations is a jargon word which everyone would identify, or

Swarup Donepudi  6:04  
I think identify the intended target audience for this will definitely be the developers, like individual developers or technical founders who started their company, etc. And for them, if we can highlight that, hey, you can exec into your container, you can stream the logs of your pods, or your developers can do it without having to set up COVID config. They can also update like explore Kubernetes resources, yaml, cited them all that from right, either using plankton CLI or dashboard. Maybe we'll again wait for chatgpt to provide us some with reasonable size of these, these things, yeah. So one of the goals for chatgpt to give me as an action item would be to rewrite or make another attempt to write a better subtitle for the hero section or even but can also do hero section before

Suresh Attaluri  6:57  
that, we need to discuss, what are those five operations, right? Yeah? Yes,

Swarup Donepudi  7:01  
those actions are to me. First of all, whenever I go to any Kubernetes dashboard, first of all, the very first thing that I want I do is filter out things so that I can find the appropriate Kubernetes services that are created for my service to do its work. Okay, okay. And

Suresh Attaluri  7:20  
how will that help any person in an organization like, will it be useful for a developer or DevOps engineer or some other role in the company will be using this?

Swarup Donepudi  7:37  
This aspect of our product is heavily created with a good developer in mind. Okay, not DevOps engineers. DevOps engineers, we believe, are capable of

Suresh Attaluri  7:47  
undoing about the service listing services part, which is not services,

Swarup Donepudi  7:52  
not listing services. Say I am working on one of the micro service within the company, okay, okay. And I want to know, I want to quickly access any Kubernetes resources that are created for my only service. Like, for example, I'm working on payment service, okay? And I only, I only care about the stuff that is on Kubernetes to make my service work, because that is where what I am here for. So what is the value there is. I want to know how many parts are running. I want to know how the deployment resource is configured. How will

Suresh Attaluri  8:30  
any typical developer will know

Swarup Donepudi  8:32  
this information? This information? Yeah, so far. So

Suresh Attaluri  8:36  
do we have any categories of these data operations? I mean, I'm just trying to drill down each option that we are providing, right? So first thing that you said is about pots. If someone want to look at how many Kubernetes pots are running, and for a particular microservice, that

Swarup Donepudi  8:55  
wouldn't be a typical requirement, and that might also be a requirement in some cases, like a is this one part, or is this four parts? Because the request seems to be going like to multiple parts. So something wrong with the load balancing? So that is one of the use cases. Are you referring to the with plantain cloud versus without life before platinum cloud?

Suresh Attaluri  9:19  
I want to know where this information is available on

Swarup Donepudi  9:25  
your asking you to show where

Suresh Attaluri  9:27  
it is available, how anyone can look at it,

Swarup Donepudi  9:30  
so we can go to one of our Redis deployments. Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  9:34  
okay, and release, deployed on Kubernetes, deployed on

Swarup Donepudi  9:39  
Kubernetes production environment. So I looked up for the Redis deployment, and then I clicked on the Kubernetes icon, which displays all the Kubernetes resources that are created in the namespace that is created to deploy this Redis Kubernetes. And these are native Kubernetes resources. And we are, at this point, we are fetching everything and just displaying them as a list, yeah, however, yeah. But this is how you developers can surface this that information, yes.

Suresh Attaluri  10:11  
So, but there is developer has to go through all these resources and look at the parts and see, okay, right now, here I see yeah in the view one part, yeah, and with that name, yeah. So

Swarup Donepudi  10:23  
we do have plans to expand this experience via this thing canvas, similar to how we, the developer, is able to explore all the deployed resources are on Canvas Explorer, we are also going to leverage the same user experience to create what is called Kubernetes Explorer, or resources explorer. Okay, so we will represent the parts visually using cards or using the pod icon and stuff, and we are going to only show the most commonly, like, interesting resources was just showing everything.

Suresh Attaluri  11:03  
That was my next point. Yeah. Developer, yeah, I don't know. I never looked at all these other resources, right? The pod is one thing which

Swarup Donepudi  11:13  
there will be a few important ones. For example, persistent volume secret endpoints are nobody cares about it, unless you are like troubleshooting some networking issue. Service is another important resource parties, another important resource service account is another one still full set is loop and ungroup.

Suresh Attaluri  11:32  
How to make this view better? Will be a different discussion. But yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  11:37  
overall, totally. So we do have an important story that we are trying to prioritize quickly, which is to improve this Kubernetes explore on Canvas, and also, like visualize only those important things and provide filters to search for others one and also searching stuff, etc. So,

Suresh Attaluri  11:57  
but right now we have this list view, yeah, so, and there's just a read view, right? Yeah, this

Swarup Donepudi  12:01  
is a list view, read view, and a developer can drill into one particular resource, like, for example, they want to see if the state full set is configured with the right amount of CPU

Suresh Attaluri  12:16  
limits or not, okay, the specification of that resource on COVID, yeah, right, a person can, I mean, a user can, yeah, it

Swarup Donepudi  12:23  
would be, it would be similar to kubectl get StatefulSet and main hyphen master with the hyphen end and the name of the namespace. That is equivalent to me clicking on the StatefulSet entry, and it shows me the YAML and also hyphen, O, yaml, you so on coupe, CTL, yeah. So we

Suresh Attaluri  12:45  
are listing the resources also. We are providing this option of viewing the spec of that, yeah. We are providing all CRUD operations, CRUD operations also on that, yeah, specification,

Swarup Donepudi  12:58  
okay, yeah, on resources and on each resource, okay, okay, like I can edit this right we are looking at state to set, and we can definitely edit this file right here. And I'm also like looking at environment variables, ports and resources. CPU limit is set to 50. I can update it to 250 right here, and immediately I can save it. That is like, update,

Suresh Attaluri  13:24  
okay, okay, so we are simplifying the access part, also for the developer, right like DevOps engineer, who's who set up this Kubernetes cluster, cluster, they have to set up the they would provide that access specific to each developer. They are going to develop, get access of these developers laptop and somehow set up that thing and provide access, but with our simplified access management,

Swarup Donepudi  13:56  
yeah, that is another key important aspect of this whole, which is the reason why we integrated Kubernetes Dashboard right alongside services. Here is to avoid that extra hassle of setting up config, like the authorization and authentication to Kubernetes cluster itself. It is a very big hassle. Usually the people do share COVID config with other developers, which has permissions to do everything, but it is hard to identify who performed what actions, so no audit is available. At least with plant on Cloud, Iam sitting in between the developers and their Kubernetes clusters. At least we do have a trail of what actions are performed by which user on plant on

Suresh Attaluri  14:39  
cloud, so that will be audited right like

Swarup Donepudi  14:42  
right now we are not auditing, but we did, I did consider in the past of auditing these API calls. Obviously, we know which API call is being made and what is the pay request payload and modification and all that. So yeah, we have the opportunity to do that as well right now, but we are not providing

Suresh Attaluri  15:02  
it yet. This Kubernetes providing that, if someone

Swarup Donepudi  15:06  
just like the way, AWS doesn't provide washing and auditing capabilities, the Kubernetes doesn't

Suresh Attaluri  15:12  
Kubernetes CL, if you use Kubernetes CLI, or any other form of modifying

Swarup Donepudi  15:18  
it, also tools to do that. Well, it's not an out of box experience.

Suresh Attaluri  15:23  
Someone has to do some extra effort and set it up.

Swarup Donepudi  15:25  
Yeah, true. So plantain products is acting, acting as a proxy between the actual Kubernetes cluster and the developers, and without any hassle of setting up the access, he's able to do these day one or day two operations

Suresh Attaluri  15:39  
as me being a developer, yeah, the other tasks that I remember is modifying deployment, like, if I have to add any environment,

Swarup Donepudi  15:47  
yeah, this is what we are talking about right now. And I believe that, yeah, another environment variable you can add, update the resources you can Yeah, you can do all sorts of edits. The way you do it using kubectl.

Suresh Attaluri  16:00  
So that covers,

Swarup Donepudi  16:03  
yeah. We are also providing a describe view. So this is equal to coupe CTL describe and the resource parameter, yeah, that is YAML view you can also edit, yeah. So, yeah, going back,

Suresh Attaluri  16:18  
yeah, yeah. Apart from this, the next thing would be accepting and seeing. So, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:24  
you can also, important, more importantly, you can also do a lot stream logs of a container. Okay, so, so you can click on pod logs, streaming pod logs, and you will be able to, you will also be able to apply some filters, like how much of this is equivalent to doing coupe CTL logs, or in fact, we did what is called Stern. Stern is a better tool, but it is not a Kubernetes native tool. It is a shell abstraction on coupe CTL. Yeah. It basically combines logs from multiple tools based on the provided filters. We simulated stern like logs right on. So I think chatgpt can make a note that, since Stern is a very big popular tool, stern is available on plant on Cloud, either via plant on CLI itself or via the console app. Okay, any so that is logs. And you mentioned about being able to exec into container, right? Yeah, so that is also available. So I can go back to the Kubernetes resources, I can click on exec into the container. So I need to select a part. I need to select exec into container, and it displays the list of containers that are available in the part. And I need to provide type, this type of shell I want to and I can I already accept into

Unknown Speaker  17:46  
it, yeah, so I can do all,

Swarup Donepudi  17:48  
yeah, you are essentially in cell, and we give web part. So, yeah, this is another thing that is loved by developers, having being able to directly exit into their part container, because that gives them a lot of tooling readily available to do more kind of troubleshooting, etc. You can expand

Suresh Attaluri  18:05  
the good use cases, like, what is the environment variable on the part or on the container? Yep.

Swarup Donepudi  18:14  
So yeah, I think we covered most also, what to summarize perform CRUD operations on the Kubernetes resources specific to your service, right in your alongside your service, you can access all of that. You will be able to perform crud on the resources themselves. You can do coup CTL get kubectl edit, kubectl delete, kubectl etc. You can do kubectl logs, which is actually stern locks, which is more improvised tool, and you can do COVID exec into container, or you can exec in, yeah, exec into another container. So these are the things that are available, and improvement planned. Improvements are definitely the canvas exploring. So we want to provide a better user experience on the console app. To do better,

Suresh Attaluri  19:00  
but future, yeah. Thing to do, yeah, so we'll

Swarup Donepudi  19:04  
conclude the meeting here. Okay, and we'll continue the next meeting with the starting with the script for the main video itself. Maybe we can also do four different smaller videos where we are showing the exploration part, being able to do some operations like edit the resources and being able to exit into container and being able to log, stream logs. Are you talking about the video script? Yeah, we'll do four smaller videos. We'll begin our next conversation around the scripts for each either each of the videos or four different videos. Okay, I'm stopping this here. Any closing notes, no, no. Okay, perfect.
