Unknown Speaker  0:10  
Oh, do you Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  0:12  
hello, welcome back. Swarup, so in our series of videos that we are making, we reached service hub, and there is a first video to discuss service hub as a feature and the media content that we are going to put on the service hub feature, feature page. Can you open the figma design, the current figma design, so this is the current figma design. The title says, streamline your micro service development with service hub. That's what is the title so, and the subtitle section is centralized, accelerate, simplify service creation with plant and cloud as enabled. So as a service hub, we have a on platform. We have the service hub, kind of market, marketplace, where, where.

Swarup Donepudi  1:22  
So this is not a marketplace, a service hub on our UX design, okay, is like an explorer, where, explorer of what? This one all your services, gaining complete visibility into every micro service within your organization. Service of provides a centralized facility where you can explore the Manage and understand all your services onboard the developer, supportlessly by game. So this is one difference between self service DevOps and service of the catalog itself.

Suresh Attaluri  1:55  
So this is not marketplace. I was thinking service hub is marketplace of CICD templates. That's what my

Swarup Donepudi  2:03  
source code template.

Unknown Speaker  2:06  
Okay, okay,

Swarup Donepudi  2:09  
there is a connection between these two. But service hub is more about

Suresh Attaluri  2:15  
what all the services, and it helps

Swarup Donepudi  2:17  
you onboard new developers quickly by instantly providing them access to all the information about the services. Who owns it, what is the language that is it is created, which environments it is deployed to, okay. Service discovery is a big problem, and internal developer portals one of the core capabilities that is expected, along with self service, self service being action oriented, service of being information present, like explorer, okay? And in future, the service hub will slowly start extending into a more of information, only, not actions. Which is like, what is the health of the service? Where are the monitors located? Where is the how can I access the logs for this on, say, my logging aggregator? So those will start to become kind of plugins. And so servicerp is definitely a big part of the internal developer platforms. There is no clear definition on like what it entails. But again, we both agreed that devs do 80% of the spend 80% of their time developing services. Yeah, so if you think about the rest of the entire platform, it only takes care of that 20% okay, like they want databases. They own this. They own that, blah, blah, blah, but they spend time in like, bootstrapping new services, which we talked about from, like the template library, they do that, and then they iterate, which is they want to set up CAC, and then they deploy, and then they want to monitor logs. All those aspects of service hub becomes like the central point and beyond.

Suresh Attaluri  3:54  
I hear what you say, but still I have my doubts. I don't have a clear picture about service hub. That's what I can say. And I believe we we had this discussion of designing service hub as well defining what a service is on plant and cloud and all. How about we show what is there right now on the platform when we talk about service, or any one example that we can take and go through that? So, so the

Swarup Donepudi  4:32  
design has a good example. These were taken from the design itself. So in our micro services, like, if you go back to the canvas, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  4:46  
no, no, let's take this example, right? I got, I saw one service called being billing API. Like, if in an organization, some team wants to Bill API back end service, what would be the journey in the context of plant and cloud? So building API back end service, they would then it is a new service that they need to build. So new services begin

Swarup Donepudi  5:19  
with bootstrapping, bootstrapping, but that's optional, also assuming they use leverage all the features that platform provides. It begins with bootstrapping using one of the template from this template library

Suresh Attaluri  5:32  
we are calling without plant and cloud. I see me going and creating a GitHub repository, yeah, but that is bootstrap plant and cloud. Also you can bootstrap pass.

Swarup Donepudi  5:42  
No, no,

Suresh Attaluri  5:44  
okay, okay, so would assume that I have already bootstrapped now, how will a user bring that service on to this service hub or and how will the other journey will be, what benefit that they're going to get? I mean, they can still have that project on GitHub, and they can do, they can do all those things, right, CICD and all. But how, how plant and cloud is bringing the difference in their workflow? Can we discuss Git

Swarup Donepudi  6:18  
repositories of everything? So it's not possible, or GitHub is not built to present your internal organization services, okay, oriented towards presenting the all Git repositories, there is a difference between a git repository and a service, okay. Now, what's the experience with planton Cloud is okay. You bootstrap your service on GitHub. Nobody knows about it. Now you want to add CICD configuration to it, yes, and you can still do that without help of plant on Cloud, yes, go into the repository. You can probably add just like the way we do, you copy the Customize files from somewhere. You copy the GitHub dot action files from another repository. That is what most people do anyway, and you're deploying the service. Now, the way planta code currently is designed to like work is assuming that they also use plankton cloud provided actions to deploy to either Kubernetes or fargate or any deployment targets that we identify the service and resist automatically register it as create a service definition. Okay, that is what I mean by register, what will happen is, during the registration process, there is a some information captured, like, which what was the identity used to deploy that particular service onto, say, micro like Kubernetes cluster. Okay, so that identity becomes the owner of the service, and where was the repository in which it got deployed from?

Suresh Attaluri  8:05  
Like, can we take a real time example, like auth service or billing API? I have a it is bootstrapped. Now it got created here. So what will the information be? I mean, do we have the profile ready for this? It's not fully built, but yeah, whatever is there, and then we can incrementally discuss, right? What are the other things are going to be added?

Swarup Donepudi  8:40  
Okay, so this is a manually added but

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
I think so it has this information, programming language and envy. I mean, at a high level, I can say the programming language and the environments the service get can get deployed, right that's the basic information that we are capturing right now, but we can extend it to so many other things we

Swarup Donepudi  9:11  
talked about, lots of extension points, which is capturing the build jobs that ran, providing a list here, If the build is running, provide a real time progress for that build, etc, etc, but we do follow up on that, yeah. So,

Suresh Attaluri  9:31  
yeah, I see your point. Like people expect service to know that on which environments the service got deployed, and what is the commit that got deployed, and all such information. Right now we have micro service instances, but,

Swarup Donepudi  9:49  
but that is not more from an ISU oriented person perspective. What is the configuration that is needed to deploy something on to what platform, platform, but that that specification is not to define service, yes, just one infrastructure component. So we are extracting some of the information from that specification and then building that service definition as a construct. So if billing is the name of the repository, and if the repository ran like, we'd have action executed and the service got deployed to Kubernetes. We take billing as the name of the service, because the repository name is billing, yeah. And we can probably provide a way for users to, like, do some different mapping. I don't know how, but, and if the service gets deployed to another environment, we add those environments to this parent definition, yeah, and in the design, if the user is here, if he clicks on. So right now, this has been pulled from search. So we are not update. We are not doing such indexing for the environment deployment map. That's why we're not displaying it here, if not, if the user clicks on this, we provide which environments it is deployed to and what so

Suresh Attaluri  11:18  
the purpose of service hub is to manage services. Right now the ability, as part of managing we have the ability to add environments to a service so that they can be deployed to multiple environments. And

Swarup Donepudi  11:34  
it is odd. It's the reverse. You can deploy to any environment that you have access to, deploying any resource. Yeah, we are capturing the information, yeah. Now this is not like the author, but

Suresh Attaluri  11:47  
like, we are not giving the option to deploy or undeploy a service onto an environment I was expecting that to be found in service of Isn't it

Swarup Donepudi  12:00  
like this cannot be deployed to something.

Suresh Attaluri  12:06  
Let's say one service is deployed on to dev and prod environments. Now I want to undeploy, or remove the deployment from dev environment. Can I do that? Can I do that operation from service, yeah. I mean, I mean, are we thinking of doing that kind of an experience is

Swarup Donepudi  12:28  
absolutely part of so when

Suresh Attaluri  12:30  
I say managing services, what do we do as part of managing I am seeing and deploying and undeploying as one of the task. We can add more things to it. And

Swarup Donepudi  12:45  
so information retrieval is surfacing in one aspect,

Suresh Attaluri  12:48  
one aspect of it, and which programming language, who is the owner of this service, so that if certain credentials, or if a developer, a newly onboarded developer to the team wants to set up a service on his local machine, they would need certain information, like which programming language, or they can still look at the readme file and all but or whom to reach out to, like the owner of the service so that setup can be done locally. So that's one thing that I'm looking I

Swarup Donepudi  13:26  
feel like I want to scope out the product in such a way. So far, we have had success in building the product based on our own requirements. I think most of the product evolved from that perspective, yeah, which is, why did we add Redis? Why did we add a success? Why did we have even add micro service to the deployment component? It's all driven by our own requirements. Mostly, yes, the rest of the components which are not fully implemented, all of that is to expand that concept and to make it more presentable and help others get the context. When it comes to service hub, I want to do the same exact thing. Why do we not have Why did we not have service hub in the first place? While we were we have already been developing services because we took it easy, meaning we were not using our own platform to take care of like, bootstrapping. We never used our platform to bootstrap. We never used our platform to configure CICD. We are doing it from like local. So we are avoiding those problems altogether, and that is the reason why we don't have that like, how many services do we have? We are going and exploring, like the micro service Kubernetes as a alternative to it. Why that should have been this place? Okay,

Suresh Attaluri  14:50  
so do you think exploring has that much of value? I'm not like just knowing the information that in a in my or in an organization, that these are the services that we have to just list those services.

Swarup Donepudi  15:09  
There is more profile to every service.

Suresh Attaluri  15:11  
Okay, which programming language, if

Swarup Donepudi  15:14  
you see the full feature set, some of the features don't are not really useful for one, one man startup, like, for example, Washington and historical jobs, right? He knows everything. And similarly, some of the features are not applicable for like, 10 member organization, because there is very few services. Everybody knows about those. So any information that is captured now go beyond and do a 50 member company, that's when people start asking, Hey, who owns the service? Who owns that service? Yeah, okay, so that, in fact, that is the reason why we didn't do much of service, because these problems are not as significant for one man startup or 10 episode, but it is expected to be a good component within internal developer platform. So I am mostly calling out the requirements from what is expected in an internal developer platform versus what we know today. Okay, because we don't know much, like even in your experience, right? You didn't spend much time dealing with any services you always I gave you, like make release you, even I did that, I created the wrong practice, I guess. But we wanted to move fast, and that is what most young startups do. They want to move fast. They want to just follow. So maybe if we start to become more disciplined and take service up seriously for the purpose of the product itself, because we are like selling the product and is expected. So if we start taking we will starting now. Will not push a commit, and if you push a commit, it has to be deployed by gate of actions from the drawer, we will remove, like access for all of us, direct Kubernetes cluster access should be removed, but see,

Suresh Attaluri  17:02  
that's a gap. I mean, lack of consider it as my ignorance when you say we'll push micro service through GitHub actions. How is that related to this service hub on plant and cloud platform. I mean, if we, even if we make that practice of GitHub, I mean deploying services through GitHub actions. How is it connected to the service hub that we service a feature that we have on plant and cloud? How are these two things? Those are CICD pipelines, right? That's how I'm that runner on GitHub, runners, I'm not able to understand how these two parts are connected. What's my question? Or

Swarup Donepudi  18:01  
yeah, thinking how to answer that. So you're, you're, you're unable to connect the dots between the concept of a service definition on service hub and a Git git repository, or a repository on GitHub which has a cacd automation setup, and that

Suresh Attaluri  18:24  
goes, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  18:27  
So how do the what is the link between these two? These two? Yes, yeah. So when I was in CDK and there were, there were a lot of services, obviously, because they're like typical, right? Yes. And there was one seven requirement from the organization saying, I need, we need a list of all the services that are being developed and how much of the resources that they are consuming. Pull up a report, okay, we want to attribute the cost of the infrastructure like, there is x, x dollars for AWS bill. Like, what the fuck is going on? And what is CDK? CDK is a software company, okay, what is the AWS used for, obviously, to provide some APIs can consume. Okay, so all of these are services. These services use data layer, some databases, so those are also deployed on AWS. I want everything to be attributed. We want a report. Report,

Suresh Attaluri  19:37  
how much is the resource services are consuming, and what the rest of the other Yeah, in

Swarup Donepudi  19:45  
both cases, zero and CDK, it didn't happen, okay. There was an initiative that began saying, Can you being an ops team or a DevOps team? Okay, can you put together a system in which we can see in real time which teams own what and where this they get deployed. What can we like have that bread crumbs? Okay, everything existed on BitBucket. Everything existed on AWS, okay, this, you can mix and match the names. Maybe you can identify that, oh, the name of the repository is named this way. Looks like this may be on like associated with that GitHub. Okay, the information is not present. You will have to go around and like, connect the dots all yourself. Okay, so what is the value of capturing information, and what is the relationship between GitHub and this information is GitHub is, is where the services are born and live during their life cycle. They get updated all the time because that's where the code lives, right? But it's common that where you name the repository in micro services world of what you're trying to use it for, okay? So it exists on GitHub, but on the day when that question was asked, nobody knew a way to get

Suresh Attaluri  21:07  
i and I'm not questioning that part of service, like earlier, also, I asked, Does listing of services have any value? You said, yes, they will. They have some value and information, information, view, view or information. You know that a particular GitHub repository is a service. We definitely have a value. But my question comes to this point, like when you said, we should make a practice of having GitHub actions for every service that we are going to deploy. Okay, assuming that we started that practice. What difference that I mean doing that practice of having GitHub actions? What difference that it is going to bring to service hub as a feature on plant and cloud, okay, so for that,

Swarup Donepudi  22:11  
I meant that so far in plant and cloud data modeling, domain modeling, we did not design the domain to accommodate those aspects of service development because we were kind of bypassing the system which

Suresh Attaluri  22:35  
which Parts of service development, adding a, adding a CS

Swarup Donepudi  22:40  
in collaboration Swarup, running make these prod is uncommon,

Suresh Attaluri  22:46  
so that CI, CD thing, GitHub, creating GitHub actions, build and deploy is something that we are doing manually from our local machines. Add any add any actions. But the difference that we are going to bring to the our platform or service hub as a feature is will add this ability to each service or option of creating those build and deployments is, I am not

Swarup Donepudi  23:18  
concretely explaining you what would happen. Okay, we start not bypassing these. We start actually making sure we do all those things with the help of plantain cloud. I don't know what the end result of plankton cloud is going to look like. However, I'm saying, if we stop doing those bypass operations, you will now focus on the domain model aspect like, yeah, those are necessary, okay, all of those things will will align with service of eventually, as to what exactly those are, I can defend right now.

Suresh Attaluri  23:59  
Yes, yes. Okay, yeah, that requires a long design discussions and all. I'm not talking about the domain discussion, but me, with all my ignorance, assuming that, like right now, you have a view right if, can I assume that I will have an option or a button here saying, build this project. Is it reasonable for me to assume that each service in service hub will have that option of building build triggers? Build triggers from IDPs. Oh, it is not even expected from, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:45  
even that is the reason like we because we are not forcing ourselves to learn the best practices. Okay, best practices, if we do, then the very basic expectation is builds are triggered by commit,

Suresh Attaluri  25:01  
pushes, yeah, sorry, not not triggering builds. How about adding a button, adding, giving an option, saying, add GitHub actions for me or GitLab pipelines for me to build this project. Is that a reasonable expectation from user? I think so. Yeah. And similarly, add deploy, okay, add deploy action for me on to this environment. Also,

Swarup Donepudi  25:44  
I can imagine those as features from service. What you are going to do is you will manually register your service, saying, add a new service to service hub, yeah, you'll come here, okay, and you'll say, here is, here is the location of my service on GitHub. Add magic pipeline in fact if you recall, that is one of things that we had in version one of the app. Yeah. You say, I think, create a service, and then you, so add those buttons.

Unknown Speaker  26:17  
Can you pause. Can you pause?

Speaker 1  26:30  
Okay, yes, yeah, the expectation or so, yeah, it is, it is reasonable to assume that we'll have an will

Unknown Speaker  26:37  
provide an option to the

Suresh Attaluri  26:40  
fact that if we stop doing things like in shortcut ways, because we

Swarup Donepudi  26:45  
will, how do Yeah, so achieve this thing? Yeah? Again, that's why I was not able to pinpoint exact like operations that we use. But I know that we are bypassing a lot of service development features without quantum cloud, yeah, and the more day we stop that, a lot is going to surface here. That's all. And one of them is definitely like, how do I add? Yeah, I see there's a lot around service as a domain object like

Suresh Attaluri  27:17  
I would like to know, what are the databases that my service got connected? I mean, dependencies or any any integration. There's so many things that we can add as soon as somebody says, service catalog, yeah, things. Two important call outs are,

Swarup Donepudi  27:36  
Hey, what is the health of the service? Who owns this service and what are its dependencies? Because if this is failing, the dependencies may be at risk, and these are in large organizations and or if, if, if I want to decommission a service, what all services will be impacted? I'm shutting down. So these are all questions that can if I want to migrate a particular database. What are those connections? I mean, there is so many things that we can do around services, but

Suresh Attaluri  28:12  
as an initial first version of service hub, we are saying these three aspects, I'm looking at three aspects. One is listing which has this information about that service, of which language that it belongs to, who is owner, or who's a person who created it, and all that generic information of service. And then we'll have these options of listing the previous deployment through listing the previous action runs. These are adding GitHub actions

Swarup Donepudi  28:44  
or those things, and then adding it have actions, and we'll,

Suresh Attaluri  28:50  
we'll discuss but use cases, which is, yeah, every life cycle around services. Who owns what? What are its

Swarup Donepudi  29:02  
dependencies? How do I how can I you configure cacd for whether it is even on GitHub or GitHub? So for example, I say, quick action. I want to configure some service, sorry, GitHub actions to service. Then the prompt will be like, Okay, what's your name of the service? And then will be like, Okay, I don't see the service registered in the service, or would you like to register? Yes. And then, okay, where is the GitHub repository? And then we should probably able to figure out, do we have credential GitHub, credential to do any operations on that, like push code to that? If so, yeah, we can add the appropriate So, yeah, I see there's so much thing that can be done at service hub level, and we have been postponed. Yeah, we are postponing it.

Suresh Attaluri  29:58  
We know what. Now. The question boils down to, what is that we can put right now? What or what is what we have on the web page? There are two things. Yeah, we can put what we can think of right now and then incrementally add more things once they are added to the platform.

Speaker 1  30:34  
Okay? So similar to our previous approach, we list down the basic things, and we'll

Swarup Donepudi  30:40  
only simplify the page to only contain those simple things. Yes. Okay, so boots, the life cycle of the services is Bootstrap. First is discover, like see what all you have. So this is already list view in service, hub, Bootstrap. This is source code template library, cookie cutter. Templates also will have Bootstrap and discover at the end. Okay, you write down the news, yeah, okay, Bootstrap and then

Suresh Attaluri  31:12  
CICD, configure, configure, cacd,

Swarup Donepudi  31:16  
configure, CAC, okay, and then operate,

Unknown Speaker  31:24  
I think again. So overlapping, right?

Swarup Donepudi  31:28  
For now, this is it, right? I think, I think we can keep, we can limit our scope, yeah, we can have these three, and then we'll, as we

Suresh Attaluri  31:37  
expand on the service, we'll add more sections to the page. Yes, we'll

Swarup Donepudi  31:42  
keep the scope as less as possible. There is so many things, and we it's, there's a good chance that we can

Suresh Attaluri  31:50  
start picking up all those other things. Yeah, it itself looks like a separate product.

Swarup Donepudi  32:01  
So also,

Suresh Attaluri  32:04  
so there will be three sections for to discover, Bootstrap

Swarup Donepudi  32:07  
and configure CICD

Suresh Attaluri  32:11  
at the top for the video. The automate based on deployments, deployment anywhere. So, yeah, configuring CICD, we can do

Swarup Donepudi  32:20  
it has two steps, build and deploy. Configuration is

Suresh Attaluri  32:25  
different from the deployment itself. Okay? So configure is like, how do you add the configuration

Swarup Donepudi  32:32  
to your repository? And deployment itself is like, what is we provide the automation, right, customize and planta, all of that. This is this path under deployment, then that should not be kept here, I believe, because deployments we already discussed on self service

Suresh Attaluri  32:51  
deployments is here is a different aspect, like the fact that no we support like, customize, so deploy. How

Swarup Donepudi  32:58  
I'm looking at it is like, when we say deployment,

Suresh Attaluri  33:03  
it is the way, how we in CA city, how we configure that deployment step, right? So do we need? Do I know? I don't know if we need to talk. Here is the aspect that I noticed we were on GitHub. And here is to present the same information, but you see it from different lenses all the time. So when somebody

Swarup Donepudi  33:23  
is looking at service of page, he won't be like, Oh, I saw the same information on a different page. So we are saying a story about just services here. And okay, configuring CICD is like, Okay, are you on GitLab? Are you on GitLab? Right? And deployments is like, we are saying our platform allows you to deploy your services to fargate, to land, to ECS or to Kubernetes engine. As part of configure CICD and configuring the deployments part of it. Are

Suresh Attaluri  34:00  
we generating a customized file? Is that what it is when we say, configure CICD, yeah, we will do dot GitHub again. These are all speculations. That's why I'm unable to give you, and

Swarup Donepudi  34:15  
I think the discussion is mostly because of lack of clarity on the design, and you don't see it in action. I didn't see it in action. Yes, you may have, but can we so there will be four categories of deployment. I

Suresh Attaluri  34:31  
already have this thing called deploy anywhere with flexibility, deploy your services to the platform. And it makes sense, right?

Swarup Donepudi  34:40  
And this is so true, so I'm just likely leaving it in there,

Unknown Speaker  34:45  
yes, yes.

Swarup Donepudi  34:47  
And cover bootstrap configure, and that is securely managed configuration

Suresh Attaluri  34:52  
and sequence is another aspect. So I believe we will cover multiple languages

Swarup Donepudi  34:57  
as well. Right when we talk about configure CICD, we

Suresh Attaluri  35:02  
are not limited to one language to for the platform provides this ability to build any software built in multiple languages. Do we need to highlight that? I don't know. Okay, like I'm not. I'm hesitating is we haven't done that yet, doesn't even support so I want to keep the

Swarup Donepudi  35:28  
content that we don't support to as minimal as possible, just a title and a simple line, and once we get it, we can update this page. And I think, based on my conversation with chatgpt, I told exactly what we do for our own services, like we put customers in the repository and we define environment variables, we define secrets. In fact, the way we modeled IAC when it came to microservices was keeping service requirements in mind right when we did say, for example, DynamoDB, we did it from what is possible for what is the possible configuration for DynamoDB table. But when we design microservice, the design actually captures a lot of our experiences in service development, like services have secrets, services have environment variables, services expose ports. Yeah, right. Services require Ingress. So we took all of that into account and created the pulumi module. Designed the API in such a way that it supports these features. And those are the features that we are highlighting. Service hub is not just this page, by the way, service hub again, lack of better name for the title we used it, and that is what you see on the app this part. But service hub is all things service in our system. Okay, so I explained all of this to chatgpt, and it came up with these titles where it says, Ingress, easy Ingress. Setup, same thing. You deploy an API, and we create an ingress endpoint for you, and it goes to the same point that the other guy is saying, commit your code, you get an endpoint back, and we do all of that right and securely manage your configuration and secrets, add environment variables, use config map, again, everything related to services only. So how about we use the same titles? Yeah, and but at the top we'll have these three sections, yes, the

Suresh Attaluri  37:29  
windows part is only discover Bootstrap and configure CICD. I think we can do

Swarup Donepudi  37:35  
development as well if something is missing.

Suresh Attaluri  37:40  
Okay, yeah, as a product, we can do that and discover. We can,

Swarup Donepudi  37:47  
can we quickly go through the scripts,

Suresh Attaluri  37:51  
scripts of how discover would be. Discover would be

Swarup Donepudi  37:56  
that same service or page, and we

Suresh Attaluri  37:58  
can search for we can do that such feature, yes, like, how, what are the go? Like, projects are there, and we can search by name, yeah, and Bootstrap can be done either way. Chat thing. Need a Java gRPC service.

Swarup Donepudi  38:15  
We need to develop the API also, okay, I'll prioritize that lots of to dos from these discussions, Bootstrap and how about discover? Discover can also be done through chat. Yeah. What do you say? Yeah. Who owns

Suresh Attaluri  38:32  
what service? Those are all service definition, APIs, Java,

Swarup Donepudi  38:39  
back end service, or Spring Boot or something like that.

Suresh Attaluri  38:43  
And then we have discover, also, discover services. I think it is already there, available like right

Unknown Speaker  38:55  
now, we can, should be modified, I guess, but service

Suresh Attaluri  39:00  
definition, service definition is just is APA

Swarup Donepudi  39:05  
research, we'll test that Discover

Suresh Attaluri  39:09  
Services. The agent should understand that it is talking about service definitions. And we

Swarup Donepudi  39:16  
have this thing, CIC, configure, CSE, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  39:22  
so these three intents should be covered, but before that,

Speaker 1  39:25  
RPCs are missing, we need to develop those as well.

Suresh Attaluri  39:31  
Those are already to do so I think everywhere.

Swarup Donepudi  39:35  
Okay, so good stuff is done. Configure is also where intent.

Unknown Speaker  39:41  
So we'll wait up until these features are

Swarup Donepudi  39:43  
RPC tested, and then we'll discuss the video script as well. Yeah, what is, yeah, we don't have the working right, so,

Suresh Attaluri  39:52  
so and the rest of the stuff is,

Swarup Donepudi  39:54  
like, all yours are, this is one home. The this itself is good jump start development with ready to use templates, but I don't say why these images. That is what happens when you give if shots to

Suresh Attaluri  40:08  
Yeah, these are not relevant images, right? Okay, no images. Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  40:12  
He came up with whatever he was able to map based

Suresh Attaluri  40:14  
on the words, service of, service of, he

Swarup Donepudi  40:17  
knew that it is service of, so I put this there, but jump start with Tempest. He doesn't know. So he kind of put random stuff. So even on the phone, we can have a short video, GIF with our screen recording, where

Suresh Attaluri  40:32  
we filter with Golang, with Python, we can see we can give that experience, Okay, jump start development with the ready to use templates again, same we can have a similar booting chart of the so we're talking about Bootstrap,

Swarup Donepudi  40:47  
yeah, cookie cutter templates, a small image, right? Maybe the chat conversation itself, or the this thing,

Suresh Attaluri  40:56  
this guy library with just cookie cutter, cutter template

Swarup Donepudi  41:00  
selected. We can do that these filters are not working, I guess. Okay, yeah, showing cookie cutter templates, say, Use Template

Unknown Speaker  41:10  
or button, etc, okay.

Swarup Donepudi  41:16  
Going back, jump start. That is Bootstrap. We can remove a

Speaker 1  41:19  
power or we can, instead of showing sorry, instead

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
of showing a cookie cutter template there,

Suresh Attaluri  41:27  
I don't know, we'll see, we can show the GitHub code itself. I thought cookie cutter template code, but it's okay, even I'm not sure it's blabbering. So let's move on. Well, whatever you said is right. We'll show the platinum clothes screenshot on. Yeah, this one can be removed. Yeah, I think he

Unknown Speaker  41:52  
used AI in a lot of

Swarup Donepudi  41:56  
places. Automate build. So that is configuring cacd, yeah, and this will probably be a screenshot of plant or chat conversation. Oh, okay, automate your build test and

Unknown Speaker  42:12  
different browser pre built GitHub actions and workflows, or that we can show the same screenshot

Swarup Donepudi  42:17  
of the source code template library with just GitHub actions filtered and and a screenshot of saying about we say, configure CICD from plant planta cloud. And we have two parallel in

Suresh Attaluri  42:35  
these files getting appeared on GitHub, something. Okay, my only hesitation, a lot of times, comes from the amount of work it takes to make that

Swarup Donepudi  42:47  
to we don't want to get greedy, yeah, if you haven't noticed, we, I think our to do list has already crossed 500 or something. Yes. So that is why I'm like, What's the simplest stuff that we can put to make make it like for example, right? Now, this is not done make sense, right? But if you put GitHub workflows and action screenshot, okay, you have something related to bills and deployments, and you're saying GitHub actions and stuff, so it makes sense. So less not deploy anywhere with flexibility. This is also probably okay. I see the image also summer sits relevant only, yeah, yeah, because of these,

Suresh Attaluri  43:30  
I guess that's fine. And unified deployment configuration. I think

Swarup Donepudi  43:35  
we'll remove this for now. We'll add it later, securely manage configuration and secrets. We'll put the environment variables and secrets customized screenshots and from two of the repositories. And I think maybe this will also right now we don't have two we are not deploying services to two different places, so unified deployment configuration comes when you have, like, a lambda service or a target service and a micro service Kubernetes sitting next to each other, okay, but the configuration is, yeah, we don't have that right now, so We'll not do that in your setup. I think, yeah, it's definitely a

Suresh Attaluri  44:18  
point right point, just thinking media perspective, what can be but is it through service that we add Ingress, or is it through,

Swarup Donepudi  44:28  
I don't know. Have we? Do

Suresh Attaluri  44:30  
you have any thoughts about it? We do at micro service level, right? The Ingress configuration, yeah, I don't know how at service level it will be micro service service. What is the difference? You mean right now we have it at

Swarup Donepudi  44:51  
this thing, right

Suresh Attaluri  44:53  
micro service level, which is associated with an environment, and it has here. The point is, you, the developer. You use platinum cloud to build your Java REST

Swarup Donepudi  45:06  
API, okay, you will get a inverse end point for you, but at service level, how will I get it? Because I have my service has multiple environments, and I can't have a single URL for all the environment.

Suresh Attaluri  45:18  
We show two URLs. So we have service definition in which we have deployment map and the resource ID of

Swarup Donepudi  45:28  
that for the deployment. We can grab that ingress endpoint and show it so it is for environment, not for service, yeah, not always services. When you're saying even for secrets and stuff, right? It is at environment level only, yeah, and remove the Customize and extend service ecosystem. I think this is good, okay, concluding, I think I don't know it's good more than enough As for this irrelevant, this will be replaced with the videos, itself, videos, and scripts we decided, will come back. Yeah.
