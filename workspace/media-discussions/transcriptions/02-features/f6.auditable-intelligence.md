Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, floor to use,

Suresh Attaluri  0:04  
okay, so this is about altable intelligence as a feature on plant and cloud platform. So, so the feature even, yeah, I'm not sure about what exactly auditable intelligence as a feature is, but when I just look at the name, it might refer to the modifications that we make on our API resources and the stack jobs that it gets triggered. Okay, we'll discuss what is the feature is all about. But coming to all the title and subtitle part which already have, which we already have. It on figma, it says, achieve full transparency with auditable intelligence. That's the title of the feature, and the subtitle section says it's simplify compliance and collaboration with auditable intelligence from planned and code. Okay, so let's discuss how this thing or how this auditability is achieved in the platform. Anything that you want to highlight here, Swarup as part of auditability,

Swarup Donepudi  1:28  
we'll keep it simple. We'll simply say developers can deploy various

Suresh Attaluri  1:39  
components

Swarup Donepudi  1:41  
and across any cloud provider, okay? And each component has a lot of configuration associated with it. Yes, change. Changing the configuration has a direct impact on the availability of services or the systems, okay? So it's important for organizations to be able to quickly understand what are those configuration changes, and that is one of the biggest reasons why every organization will prefer IAC infrastructure as code, as opposed to allowing developers to modify resources on AWS, because there is no centralized view on on that versioning, like when you do IAC, you're doing it in the form of code. When you're writing code, you have the power of Git, which so you can leverage the ecosystem, Git ecosystem, via GitHub and stuff where there is commits and all that diff view, etc, right? So that is why there is a lot of push towards using IAC versus this. So for the same exact reasons, we made sure that, for those reasons, for the same reasons, that organizations will prefer IAC over using web interfaces. Yeah, at the heart of that is definitely the auditability. What, and what is the impact of those changes on the infrastructure, so

Suresh Attaluri  3:08  
users who would like to know who made the modification, when they have made the modification, and what is the modification, it's all about. But saying all that GitHub, already has those features if you put your infrastructure as code on to as a as a GitHub repository. But since we are bringing the configuration to to an API. We are moving from a GitHub file, we are bringing

Swarup Donepudi  3:47  
the whole idea of self service is to provide the simplest way for developers to deploy and GitHub repositories, and putting configuration in GitHub is again another friction, which is not Yeah, which is not as efficient from a self service perspective as like, the chat interface or anything,

Suresh Attaluri  4:06  
right? Yeah, whatever it is, we took the decision that we move the configuration from a GitHub file to an API.

Swarup Donepudi  4:14  
Well even, okay, yeah, so,

Suresh Attaluri  4:17  
and now, by doing that, we lost the power of that GitHub auditability of knowing when then we in planting Cloud Platform. Also we had to build a similar ability to identify when that configuration has been modified and who and what has been modified. I mean, am I putting it right?

Swarup Donepudi  4:41  
Yeah, so we didn't take away that ability of putting the configuration in GitHub. The configuration can still, like users can go to GitHub, and this can actually be a demo. They can create a repo, and they can call it as Redis, my Redis Database, okay? And they will create a file called Redis dot yaml, and they will put ABA version, Redis, Kubernetes,

Suresh Attaluri  5:08  
all of that, all the API application specification changes.

Swarup Donepudi  5:11  
Here they can use Version controlling Yes, so they are getting that version controlling if they choose to Yes, but we are providing the self service capabilities via conversational interfaces or key cops, right? So we are saying auditable intelligence, which is we are providing the artificial intelligence yet we are retaining the auditability. Yes, so, but you're right in a way that there is no additional problem we are solving here. Yes, we are simply highlighting that even though, see, for example, why did you not use AWS in the first place? Is lack of transparency, yes, and there is no central view for an organization to know who made what when and what is and we are simply presenting to the audience that, yeah, we have like you can expect something better from us. People click buttons, but everything is

Suresh Attaluri  6:14  
audited. You're moving away from it not using GitHub to manage your configs, by not using a GitHub to manage your countries, you are not losing anything. You have. You have all that auditability, definitely

Swarup Donepudi  6:30  
doing anything better, but at least we have not taken like, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  6:35  
you you have all the information here as well. That's what the point is. And coming to the Okay, how about the I see heading is good enough, and the subtitle as well simplify compliance and collaboration with orthogonal Yes. And what now, when we talk about video, what part of the plant and cloud is that we need to show to users.

Swarup Donepudi  7:04  
Start with the chat conversation. Okay, we can say demodb, table, hash key, no,

Suresh Attaluri  7:11  
but which part of it is considered as or as auditable, like IAC workflows, we show stack job blocks,

Swarup Donepudi  7:21  
so we start with stack the chat. Let me deploy something which is a DNA, more DB table, okay? And we update the hash key name from X to Y, okay, okay. And we go back to the dashboard and look up that resource, go to its version history and show that, okay, so see how the changes are being captured, and also see that every change has an associated

Suresh Attaluri  7:46  
job. And you know that this change has deployed or not, yeah, you by correlating with

Swarup Donepudi  7:54  
within that stack job. And then I'll show you a quick example of that, which is AWS, VI, N,

demo table. Okay, so I changed the update hash key from lock, ID to lock, no,

Suresh Attaluri  8:27  
okay, okay. And

Swarup Donepudi  8:31  
you can see in the div section that, in the div section it says, One day, one will be replaced. Okay, okay. Why is it replacing? Because you changed the name from lock ID to lock. No,

Suresh Attaluri  8:49  
yeah, yeah. So there are two level. I see there are two levels of the sortability, one being the API resource or the config modification that user is providing, and the effect that config modification has on the eventual infra or event show or the cloud provider, right? Yeah, right.

Swarup Donepudi  9:14  
That's it. That's it. And we'll compute that will show, okay, I let okay. You have the history of history.

Suresh Attaluri  9:22  
History of history. You go, you can go through this, and we can highlight that every modification on plant and code is associated with a commit message, like, like GitHub. You

Swarup Donepudi  9:35  
can click on that to see in multiple Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  9:39  
So again, coming back to the video, can we just quickly discuss the steps? We present, the intent, the chart of modify, creating or modifying a DynamoDB. Creating a DynamoDB or just modifying the DynamoDB, you can start

Swarup Donepudi  9:56  
with, say, I would like to look up the configuration for an existing DynamoDB. And then I want to change the lock key from so and so so. So this is a known change that that is capturing more meaning. It definitely shows a diff in the infra. Also, I'm choosing the hash key rename, yeah, yeah. So

Suresh Attaluri  10:15  
we'll mention the intent of modifying it. Will modify it, and we'll jump from chart to the dashboard or the this thing Quick Search, where we search for that resource ID will open version history. We show the that there's a new commit that has been added, or version that has been added will go through the diff in Version History, and from Version History, we'll move to, we'll click on the stack Job Status icon that will move to, that will redirect us to a new page. There, we talk about the diff available in stack job blocks, and we show the difference that the provider

Swarup Donepudi  11:03  
end, yeah, so that will be the video. That will be the video. And here in this section, we'll simply show the screenshot of the big diff. And the pulumi diff has two screenshots. Okay, random image.

Suresh Attaluri  11:18  
What are those headings?

Swarup Donepudi  11:21  
Random stuff,

Suresh Attaluri  11:22  
and they can still be there

Swarup Donepudi  11:25  
complaints, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  11:28  
unified git diff format, yeah, we can show that diff.

Swarup Donepudi  11:31  
So here we have two screenshots. So maybe we'll show the chat part here, because the chat will also show unified diff, right? So we'll simply show that chat screen just from the recording where we demo we'll take a screenshot of that, or we'll take it later. But we are simply showing the video from the chat full chat context.

Suresh Attaluri  11:57  
We can add those lists right views of version history that's better stack job, list of stack jobs and list of versions better here, yeah, list of stack jobs and list of this thing will have a nice format

Swarup Donepudi  12:11  
here. We can show that you diff in to like both chat and the actual unified

Suresh Attaluri  12:19  
git di format for clarity. Yeah, that sounds good. Here we can put the pull images, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  12:28  
and audit trace wherever you are. I don't know if this is required, okay, we'll remove that. Real Time Tracking. We can remove this also stack jobs for every change is, again, is probably redundant. Oh, no, you highlighted this multiple times. Every configuration change,

Suresh Attaluri  12:53  
I think we have, we not this will be covered in that part,

Swarup Donepudi  13:00  
the things that I learned from GitHub and prompted chat GPT to say, yeah, it's okay to be returned the information in different places from different lenses. Yeah. Stack jobs here is in the context of visibility, like documenting deployment jobs, yeah. So here again, it's okay. We'll simply show again, stack jobs list. That's fine, yeah? But that's fine, as long as it's not wrong, right? Now, the goal is to make this, I think, just less wrong,

Suresh Attaluri  13:32  
yeah, putting the stack job list itself talks about it, right, like it has that nature of Russian history of Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  13:41  
for that, for these stack jobs history, we want to actually create a list of stack jobs for one of the resources. Instead of like creating something on that, yeah, they will just do a bunch of modifications and take screen that is far more easier than getting something on figma, right? Yes, empower your team and secure with developers and organizations again, as long as we don't need images, we will not make modifications here. So it's just okay interact through deployment changes tracking, yeah, we'll simply Yeah, even

Speaker 1  14:20  
disrespect you. I think

Swarup Donepudi  14:26  
I'll simply remove lead plant or your a power DevOps co pilot. Instead, we'll say interact through chat to make deployment changes and receive immediate tracking updates, including diff stack drop logs right within your conversation. And here are the benefits from for developer input, collaboration, Premier tools and organizations. I don't know what is here, but it is very similar to this kind of stuff. Yeah, for these, we are not touching them, as long as these are relevant. Like it says familiar to GitHub, it says enhanced transparency. So the icon, so these are things that it shall put with the relate. So collaboration is like multiple, yeah, stuff. So we'll leave those axes. And here also the images needed incident response and troubleshooting. So these are, like, use cases and scenarios as to why customary people. I think this is not the right one. I think he copied it from page, okay, helping new team members together in past changes. Okay, again, this is probably from chat GPT. He wrote it. And no media needed here, so we'll keep that, and that's the end of the page. Yeah? So short and sweet discussion. We knew that because we know we've done a lot of implementation here. So I think one of the takeaway from all these conversations is whenever we have good like working software, clearly built with purpose, we both understand that there is less discussion for things like service of which doesn't

Suresh Attaluri  15:55  
work, which even we don't have clarity

Swarup Donepudi  15:59  
or not on same page, like, for example, Kubernetes dashboard. You need to learn a lot. Ise workflows. Again, we are not, like, fully aligned on what is values, etc. Sorry. So we both not implemented, not aligned, so took a lot of time. So I think, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  16:20  
next big thing that we can close is those videos, the hero section videos, yeah, I believe we should target those that should be the base of our when we do the video, obviously we're going to, like, create a lot of stuff. Yeah, we'll have more action items,

Swarup Donepudi  16:43  
I think consistent resource IDs and stuff will name the resources suitable for demo purposes. Yes,

Suresh Attaluri  16:51  
yeah, okay, and we'll

Swarup Donepudi  16:52  
create a sample organization, and we will consistently use the same organization across Yeah, we'll ask chatgpt to give us a name that is suitable to use for all the demos.

Suresh Attaluri  17:05  
Yes. Cool.
