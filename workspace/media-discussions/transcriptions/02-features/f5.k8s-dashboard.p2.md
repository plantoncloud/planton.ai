Swarup Donepudi  0:00  
Yeah, okay, so going back, yeah, we are doing that problem on every page, oh,

Suresh Attaluri  0:06  
problem on everything that

Swarup Donepudi  0:09  
or not, it's not, probably consistent, I guess I don't know, deployments, yeah, this one, we are not like articulating clear problem or anything.

Suresh Attaluri  0:21  
Yeah, well, that we can take decision, right? But in case of Kubernetes dashboard, let's decide if it has problem should be there or not, and what is the current problem. And applications move from local deploy development to Kubernetes clusters, unexpected behaviors can raise accessing logs, environment variables and configurations becomes a hurdle without the right tools. Plant and cloud addresses these pain points ahead on.

Swarup Donepudi  0:50  
So maybe this can be refreshed to say again the same thing, right? I explained why we built it in first place in great detail in our previous conversation. So I'll rely on chat GPT to give us a better like problem statement based on that description. Yes, this is more like a much broader goal claim.

Suresh Attaluri  1:13  
How about the image? Are we still good with the image? Or maybe we

Swarup Donepudi  1:18  
can add screenshots and screenshots of

Suresh Attaluri  1:24  
execing into a board that looks fancy, I believe. So we we add some commands, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  1:31  
maybe we can add multiple cards here, saying, I want the problem, clearly, calling out the problems, saying, I would like to, like, modify the Kubernetes resource directly. I would like to exec into a pod container. Or we can put the screenshots of each of those, but that might also become redundant. That's like a solution, right? This is more like a problem statement area if you directly put the screenshots of our app, we are saying, This is how we should. How

Suresh Attaluri  2:05  
about we put a video here as well and explain the problem? Okay, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  2:10  
that is also okay.

Suresh Attaluri  2:17  
Problems, I believe, are more I see the nature of problem. Can't we put put it through a screenshot or image? Right? The font could be more verbal. I mean, I'm talking in context of all the problem statements that we are going to decide, okay, and finding a single image to explain a problem. Yeah, might be difficult. Like for solution, we have a form, right? Like when we talk about Kubernetes dashboard as a solution, we can put on some images

Swarup Donepudi  2:51  
from the app, from the app. For all solutions, yeah, we can come up with the screenshots or recordings from the app. But when talking about the problem itself. That is when. So all problem statements will do video.

Suresh Attaluri  3:08  
We'll do that.

Swarup Donepudi  3:09  
Yeah, I think that's more better. Like, why we did it? Why did we decide to build Kubernetes dashboard? Why did we build IAC workflows, even for IAC, even for plantora, for everything we do, we have a while, which is very difficult to explain in using these creatives, infographics or, yeah, that becomes that requires, you know, creativity which we lack, I guess, yeah, so I think videos straightforward. We can do it. No creativity required. We'll have a little extra time to cover a lot of like, explain the problem. So, too. So, yeah, yes, I know. So we will put a video directly here, saying, watch the video to understand why we built this, and we'll see how, if you're going is going to style it. And for me, except for the landing page, for me, I think the rest of the pages are more about not being fancy, but more being like informative, a new platform, new product in the market. The more information we provide, we cannot that we will never be able to convince a future customer of ours, whether they are one developer or two developer or 10 developer company with our like, amazing website. Yeah, it's always about the problems the solutions. So yeah, I think I'm not too worried about whether or not putting a video here makes a website look ugly or beautiful, yes, but

Suresh Attaluri  4:44  
yeah, I think we can always have a thumbnail, fancy thumbnail, to keep it Yeah. Next thing, yeah, here we can put a simplified communities. Day two operations. How about we'll

Swarup Donepudi  5:03  
do just one, one section for each of the problem, for

Suresh Attaluri  5:07  
each of the problem. Yeah, no need for what is, what is the problem, these ones, so each of the solutions, right?

Swarup Donepudi  5:14  
Okay, yeah. So Operation challenge, we are already covering it.

Suresh Attaluri  5:18  
Yeah. We covered the problem, and we show those sub features or what solutions that we listed already, the four of them or three of them on this listing. And crud, I also

Swarup Donepudi  5:32  
need to remove i Okay, forgot to give a better prompt to chatgpt where I wanted all the statements to be passive context, but it gave it in like we act. Discover how it is active context. So I like to update those meaning. Discover how. Not a good statement here, but okay, so should it be? It should have been like a plant on Cloud transforms the way developers not discover how, okay, discover how is, like, you're asking the user to do something next, but we don't do anything there. Like, yeah, maybe, maybe the prompt that I gave it was, like, I'll put some type of video next to each section. So it may have assumed that there is going to be a video here. So discord, how means, watch the video. So, okay, simplified Kubernetes data operation. So platinum pro transforms away developers handle post deployment challenges in Kubernetes environments. It simplifies operational tasks so you can so devs can focus on building great applications without getting bogged down by infrastructure complexities. Yes, so maybe we can keep this as well. And this is also like a good infographic, and we'll leave it at that. Okay, and no need for Direct cluster access, again, some same thing that we would explain here in the operational space. We are explicitly calling out that too. For those who don't watch the video, I

Suresh Attaluri  7:09  
think this should be at the top and then simplified, oh, we all also have other sections. My point is, oh, okay, okay. We have, okay, we have those sections, and then real

Swarup Donepudi  7:24  
time, log, streaming, execute comments inside. This is more

Suresh Attaluri  7:29  
the stuff that we talked about

Swarup Donepudi  7:34  
based on our discussion. I'll, I'll see if I can come up with updated sections for this. But okay, I think at this point,

Suresh Attaluri  7:43  
I think every section will have a screenshot as a media media friend, as for these,

Swarup Donepudi  7:49  
like fancy icons, we leave it for shaft to decide he'll use those to make the page look less boring, I guess. But we'll take the screenshots from the same videos that we record. I think, I think I have sufficient content to at least get the first content version out.

Suresh Attaluri  8:12  
So, and I see a lot of things written after this point. What is

Swarup Donepudi  8:15  
it edit Kubernetes on the fly, which is probably similar to we will manage Kubernetes. So this is like a read, I guess, and manage may include edit as well, according to us, but this one says it's

Suresh Attaluri  8:30  
about editing. What is other section,

Swarup Donepudi  8:33  
enhanced permission, manage security. So this is already like this is talking about. I think this will fall under no direct Kubernetes access required. This is duplicates and use cases again. I think this can be removed. This section two and

Suresh Attaluri  8:52  
debugging made simple. What are these sections?

Swarup Donepudi  8:56  
Yeah, this can be removed. Yeah, yeah, good. I think it doesn't have to be like, purposefully long, yes, making our job difficult to complete the page. Actually, I'll take care of removing unneeded parts as discussed. Okay, you have any closing remark? Or

Suresh Attaluri  9:19  
can I stop? No, I think we can consider the two minutes dashboard has done.
