Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, the meeting recording began, and we are going to talk about ISC workflows. Flow to you, Suresh,

Suresh Attaluri  0:12  
yeah, ISC workflows, but

Swarup Donepudi  0:17  
remember that this is going to be both Lumi and TerraForm. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  0:23  
and I see some change in the pattern, change in this page. I don't know if that is intentional or for some reason, like the other pages have the content and vertical one after the other, top to bottom. Okay, okay, but here I see this one more appealing, and this side of it is some text, and I believe here on to the right side you like this, that is top to top down way of putting things, and this is left to right way of putting the things right. So I don't know I like this one you can alternate. Might be a personal choice.

Swarup Donepudi  1:17  
One top down, we can say combination of second one to be left, right and then third one to be again center, fourth one to be like, left, right and fifth one to be center. Sixth one, yeah, we can alternate, yeah, yes. Okay.

Suresh Attaluri  1:37  
So again, as all our other discussions, the first thing we'll need to figure out is talk about the title here. The title says deployments with pulumi IAC. That will be changed. That will change to deployments with pulumi slash. How about we mention about the agnostic ability of the platform to make the users choose pulumi Or

Swarup Donepudi  2:10  
nobody wants that. Nobody

Suresh Attaluri  2:13  
wants that. So though we don't want to

Swarup Donepudi  2:19  
ask for it. Yeah, so

Suresh Attaluri  2:21  
yeah, I don't know. One thing that I can tell when I read that heading or title is it's not that catchy, like compared to other feature pages, any other feature pages. That's one thing we are open for the chatgpt to recommend for any recommendations, and coming to subtitle, it says, automate, streamline and scale your multi cloud deployments effortlessly with plant and clouds integrated infrastructure as code, CICD pipeline. Yeah, it, in a way, gives nice one line,

Swarup Donepudi  3:05  
okay, so the title can be better, but subtitle is okay. Subtitle is okay. And here it's going to be a video.

Suresh Attaluri  3:13  
So when we talk about video, my question is, what is that part we when we say IAC workflows, what is the part of plant and plot? We are calling it as Ise workflows. And my understanding correct me if I'm wrong, the stack job creation on when a API resource is modified or any cloud operation made on a deployment component API resource of available on brand and cloud platform. If some modification is done, then that automatically triggers a creates a stack job. This whole behavior of creating stack job for each modification, is what we are calling it as IAC workflow.

Swarup Donepudi  4:05  
Yes, right, yeah. And

Suresh Attaluri  4:07  
when we when, if you want to draw parallels with GitHub, GitHub also has IAC workflows, but the how GitHub operates is someone pushes a commit to GitHub project, it initiates, it triggers a GitHub action, or that's what we are calling it as. That's what ISC workflow at GitHub level. Similar in our case, it's a stack job, stack job.

Swarup Donepudi  4:39  
The key difference is a GitHub by default doesn't come with any IAC workflow at all. Okay? Is you as an organization who is using GitHub, you need to find somebody who can set those things up for you, meaning, it needs to be like GitHub action and then also create experience. It's not integrated into GitHub,

Suresh Attaluri  4:59  
but here we provide both, right? We provide customization also, like you can put your own definitions for your Git,

Swarup Donepudi  5:11  
taking away the ability for you to do the same exact thing. Like you put your manifest in GitHub. You add a GitHub action, you may come into that configuration, same GitHub action, nothing, no change. No. I'm

Suresh Attaluri  5:26  
saying, I'm talking about IAC workflows. You said there won't be any predefined IAC workflows at GitHub level, yeah. But when we are saying that there will we have an effect on plant and cloud with predefined ASU workflow setup, right? They get triggered. How is that possible? Is because there are certain the platform itself provides some pulumi module modules,

Swarup Donepudi  5:55  
and the important part for the Integrated workflows is not about the pulumi modules that we created, they play an important role. However, we build the system in such a way that every modification to configuration will automatically trigger a refresh, followed by a preview and followed by an apply or update step. So whether it is TerraForm or pulumi, according to stack job configuration, the automatic triggering of that without you having to do anything. And also the workflow is, it is these workflows are very well aware of the infrastructure as code tooling, meaning there is refresh, there is preview, and there is apply or update. Nobody needs to learn anything new. Nobody needs to configure anything new, right? So the integrated IC IAC workflows like GitHub has, it has a like a automate all solution in the form of actions. So there is no first class support for like these preview so you won't see them nicely lined up unless you do something there. And there is state backing that is, again, you need to set something up there that comes out of the box. And there is nice integrations that we provided, like you connect your pumi or your TerraForm those back ends, and the application, the platform that we have built has first class support for all of these. We recognize pulling the back end as a thing. We allow the users to configure it, or we provide one out of the box, and provider credentials is a first class citizen on our system. So all these, what do

Suresh Attaluri  7:39  
you think that we need to put all those things here, we should have a separate, connect specific feature, or, I don't know, those adding from

Swarup Donepudi  7:53  
like, what is the value offered by plan term cloud in The form of integrated IAC workflows, is you make modifications to your configuration out of the box. You you get IAC experience of preview, refresh, all of that. Okay, along with the credential management, I'm not talking about the possibility of connecting something in connections page. I'm saying we built the system of this IAC, where credentials are in play an important role, just came back and plays an important role. And we built those things into and we have put together a nice system for you which covers all these aspects. You don't have to do anything. So, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  8:37  
yeah, I think we establish the scope of this feature, I believe I surf flows, make some modification. What is the effect? Is triggering this tag draw with which has refresh preview and apply?

Swarup Donepudi  8:54  
Yeah. So let's talk about the video script. Video Script, I'll tell you the script. Tell me, if that makes sense, yes. So the video begins with saying, as a developer, I want to deploy DynamoDB table.

Suresh Attaluri  9:10  
And this you do through and

Swarup Donepudi  9:12  
the way you do a chat, chat, you begin with chat, and we say, when the DynamoDB table is being deployed, you see pulumi review, refresh automatically trigger and execute. So

Suresh Attaluri  9:24  
user will put the intent and will cut the duration, cut the video to this thing, the pulumi stack this thing. Okay, yeah, and we'll show that refresh coming up. And

Swarup Donepudi  9:44  
we highlight those aspects in this video, in this video, not the chat parts, but we say, notice how the automatically, there is a pulumi Refresh so or TerraForm refresh, or TerraForm plan or apply without you having to do anything.

Suresh Attaluri  9:59  
Do we need? Do you think we need to also mention about the pulumi module and the resources that are being created here? That

Swarup Donepudi  10:05  
is the next step, which is for without what would have what would you have done without this experience is you would set up something on your computer like you would configure a machine to with pulumi state backend. These are all things that you need in order for this to work, TerraForm state backend, store. TerraForm state you need TerraForm module to run, and you need a central server to run the TerraForm these steps. All of that is done for you. The TerraForm state backend is already provided. TerraForm. What is it? What is it? I said, three things, state backend, the runner. I said, the second. Module, module, yeah. So you're getting the state back and out of the box. Your, there are default modules for everything, and your the stack job runner is also provided for so don't do anything. All of that comes out of the box. And also, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  11:14  
but do you think you need to? We need to show the we need to. How will you demo it? We verbally saying that this at the back end. These three are, or again, or we jump, or we only choose to show the pulumi module. I don't know if we can show the back, pulumi back and as in, in visible form. So these

Swarup Donepudi  11:38  
are also concepts, right? Yeah. So this will go into iPad. This

Suresh Attaluri  11:43  
can go into the thing, right? You need to set up this so we can consider

Swarup Donepudi  11:48  
so it's very easy to do something like, for example, if I open a video, yesterday's video, and I say, explainer, right? So if you watch this video, you will see I've done something to show things. You see this while I'm explaining this, right, while I while I'm on the console app, talking about saying to achieve the same exact thing you would need plumi back and pulumi module. I can do a white like iPad explanation as a side creation. Then we can include that here. We can play that video here as well. Yeah, as we speak, we can say you need pulumi module. You would need a stack job runner as

Suresh Attaluri  12:42  
a computer. The whole point is this part that you need all these things to be set up will fall under the problem section of it. I don't think it will be coming into this video, the main hero section video, we only show the user putting the intent on the chart and its stack job being triggered, the stack job will have the link of pulumi module, like that's the feature that we are planning to implement.

Swarup Donepudi  13:13  
Yeah, the as as you update the configuration, it got deferred, and you are able to see the live progress and control the history the deployment component store. This is all you can deploy using these Ise workflows. And here is the module registry. I think we can simply just show the whole thing, instead of being like, Yeah, I like the aspect that you brought up, which is, don't go into like, what would happen if you don't have these and that you'll simply show what we have in the platform. That is the easiest way for us to do it, right, like,

Suresh Attaluri  13:43  
or even we can end it using giving the intent and,

Swarup Donepudi  13:48  
yeah, this is okay. I just deployed the table. But here is all the stuff that your developers can deploy by showing deployment component, store, no, no that comes

Suresh Attaluri  13:58  
under the service, service, self service thing, right? Let's not mix. The only point is keep as precise as possible and as targeted.

Swarup Donepudi  14:08  
Integrated IAC workflows only showing as soon as I did something, the workflow is already integrated. It's triggering. It's

Suresh Attaluri  14:16  
triggering. You have the refresh. You see the refresh says that it has some back end state back end, and you're getting the these things, and you we have the other things. And we can make a choice of modifying, okay, we can do this refresh. We can do two things. We create a DynamoDB, modify it, and we can show that the Refresh is now changed in a way that talks about the back end as well, right? Yeah, stay back. And it's not, it's not a stateless thing that's being done. And, yeah, we'll explain. We'll talk about the resources that are there on the stack job blocks.

Swarup Donepudi  14:59  
Are we good? Yeah, yeah, this is the video, and it says, built in IAC workflow. It just works. And we'll have, we'll have

Suresh Attaluri  15:09  
stack job screenshot, job lock, screenshot,

Swarup Donepudi  15:12  
screenshot here, stack job bundles, columi operations, again, I think this is good enough.

Suresh Attaluri  15:19  
Yeah. Number here, it would be, instead of using pulumi, we can use pulumi slash TerraForm operation, so something of that. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  15:32  
and advanced flow controls. I think this is good enough customers with advanced this is what we provide to i I configure previous approvals, execution steps. Yeah, this is all part of the same thing, real time monitoring and a generated summaries.

Suresh Attaluri  15:56  
Real time monitoring and a generated summaries. So I'll remove, what is this?

Swarup Donepudi  16:02  
I'll remove real time monitoring here. I'll just have a generated summaries.

Suresh Attaluri  16:07  
Do we have that? Oh, we were planning to do that, right? Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Can come down. What is the other No, no, sorry, not down. Okay. Advanced flow controllers. You're

Swarup Donepudi  16:19  
good. Real time monitoring will be removed. A generated summaries says our real time monitor is our terminal, like interface, storage, complex logs into understandable and this will be a screenshot of a generate is real

Suresh Attaluri  16:39  
time monitoring is that one, which, which you we used to highlight earlier, which we used to call real time logs

Swarup Donepudi  16:48  
like terminal like interface on the web,

Suresh Attaluri  16:52  
the logs only right the what are the resources that are being we can still mention Right, terminal

Swarup Donepudi  16:58  
like interface. These two should not have been combined, combined, yeah, terminal, like, interface on web,

Suresh Attaluri  17:09  
yeah, real real time updates. Real time updates, right? Isn't it? Okay? Real time monitoring or okay thing, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  17:18  
real time not monitoring, I

Suresh Attaluri  17:23  
don't see the value of terminal like,

Swarup Donepudi  17:27  
interface, even real time monitoring is probably, I don't know, going back to what you mentioned, which is, like, people on the like, see that, like, Oh, Does it provide real time monitoring? That's great. I don't think that's the case. Okay, okay, you are basically like GitHub, when you run an action, they are not claiming that, oh, as the action is getting executed, you can see the real time progress of the action. Yes, yes. It's obvious. Like, action only you're seeing Yes.

Suresh Attaluri  18:01  
But the reason that earlier, when we were trying to highlight this part of the product, the reason was no one else was providing this feature other IDP solutions, they were just

Swarup Donepudi  18:17  
showing a view, we don't know, not showing the terminal like progress, but not they are showing real demo, okay, but not the terminal like interface. And this point, we kind of discarded down.

Suresh Attaluri  18:32  
Let's have a generated summaries, and we'll have

Swarup Donepudi  18:35  
a generated summaries as the section, yeah, and this is a generated summary, complex logs into understandable, yeah, jump straight will be removed. This is copy pasted from somewhere. Multi cloud varies. I think it is also from copy paste from somewhere we remove that enhanced control with custom stack job runners. So this will be like, the will show connections page with,

Suresh Attaluri  19:06  
okay, instance to control custom stack job runners, okay, so Ise runners, right? That's what we meant. Okay,

Swarup Donepudi  19:17  
I'll simply put a connections screenshot, yes, yes. And highlight,

Suresh Attaluri  19:21  
like, bring it, bring their own runners concept, okay, yeah, we can Yes, this is not discussed at the top, but we are saying like this, five secure

Swarup Donepudi  19:35  
and flexible credential management, manage provider credentials, and pull me straight back and securely communicate various levels. Various levels. And this one again, connection management,

Suresh Attaluri  19:50  
okay, but does this fall under ISC, both the stack job thing, also of stack job? Yeah, it is, in a way, connected the this part credential management.

Swarup Donepudi  20:09  
Okay, we'll remove it,

Suresh Attaluri  20:11  
or we can say secure way of connecting state

Swarup Donepudi  20:17  
backends. I think at this point I am kind of burdened with so much to do. So we'll remove the okay to remove parts. No can react them if needed

Suresh Attaluri  20:28  
collaboration and transparency, of course. Again, this, I don't see this thing,

Swarup Donepudi  20:34  
deployment, industries and children. This can go into the auditable intelligence. So I'll remove these two sections. Okay, cool.

Suresh Attaluri  20:45  
I think that covers. I see one source, kind of a shorter width.
