Suresh Attaluri  0:10  
Okay, Suresh, would you like to begin?

Suresh Attaluri  0:17  
Yeah, so this is about service, self service DevOps feature page in our website. So as a feature name, like I said, self service DevOps, we need to finalize the other sections of this page, the first being title hero section, or hero section, right now we have it as unleashed, developer autonomy with self service, DevOps, okay, in general. When we also discussed about other pages, I was not looking at any meaning of this hero section, this thing, I believe that's what for you as it is more a flashy line,

Swarup Donepudi  1:08  
catchy sales oriented lines. Okay, so

Suresh Attaluri  1:11  
unless developer autonomy with self service, DevOps and this, these few words, doesn't make sense to me, I don't know what to take from this, but if you're good with it, yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  1:25  
given our own experiences around work experience, it is difficult for us to come up with those statements in the first place. Okay? So all we can definitely do is talk about or what the problem is about, discuss the solution in great detail, and hand off the actual requirement to chat GPT saying we are building a sales website, okay? And here are the most important sections on our website, and one of them is self service, DevOps. Here is a detailed transcription about what it is, why we built it. What does it do? Etc, etc. Can you give me three or four hero section titles and subtitles? I chose what I felt like is the best way. Yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  2:10  
on hindsight, if when I again read this thing, it tells the story, also unleashing developer autonomy is empowering developer with this evolve service DevOps or tools that we are provided through planet cloud, right? Like, yeah, it is not that out of the line as well, unrelated as well. Yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  2:33  
the Excel that we did is exactly what I said and I chose what I felt like was the most appropriate, or what might kind of express the meaning. So chose those and yeah, and because these are concepts for us, like, for example, self service DevOps is a concept I don't know if there is a even I remember you asking me or telling me that you don't understand what what self service DevOps means exactly a year, a year ago when we first talked about it. Yeah, right. So you were completely unfamiliar with the whole concept, and the more we talked about it,

Suresh Attaluri  3:09  
I'm still skeptical about what I don't have its clear definition, but there's no clear definition in the market as well. It

Swarup Donepudi  3:18  
is hard to come up with what is appropriate when there is no clear definition, yeah? So

Suresh Attaluri  3:23  
yeah, in this recording, we'll try to figure out a definition in plant and clouds context, yeah, we'll do that, yeah. What is self search those but before

Swarup Donepudi  3:33  
that exercise has already been done, okay? And this output is an out. This is an outcome of that exercise, yeah, but we have another opportunity with where you and I are, yes, yes. The previous time it was me explaining the solution to chatgpt. This is more of a discussion, so I think maybe better another we can that exercise itself is very easy, yeah, I taking the transcript and asking for So, yeah, we can do 10 and shot

Suresh Attaluri  4:03  
on. How about the subtitle part where it says, empower your team to build, deploy scale faster than ever with land and clouds AI driven self service solutions? Yeah. It tells about, uh, would. I don't see any problem with the with that sentence,

Swarup Donepudi  4:28  
we can move on. These don't have to be perfect, yes,

Suresh Attaluri  4:32  
and they're serving them, they will keep scrolling down. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  4:35  
they'll be able to understand or get the gist of what it is all about. Yes, they keep going like every sentence in isolation does not have to convey a full meaning. Okay, yeah, so, so down. This is

Suresh Attaluri  4:51  
like a hint to what we can show like any other page we have the we need to figure out the video section of it, right?

Swarup Donepudi  4:58  
Yeah, yes. So

Suresh Attaluri  5:02  
then comes the question, like defining self service DevOps in plant and cloud context, what is self which part of plant and clouds project will be considered as self service DevOps? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  5:19  
so I think a little bit of context there is we chose to build. I mean ignoring all of the historical context on how we arrived at building, what is built today. Okay, ultimately, we identified ourselves or associated our product under the category of internal developer platforms? Yes, and one of the core tenets for any internal developer platform is to enable developers to fulfill their requirements, which have been classified classically put under DevOps requirements. These internal developer platforms enable developers to self self service their own requests. So classic examples would be, I want to deploy my micro service onto wherever, whether it is simple virtual machine, or whether it is a Kubernetes as a micro service, or whether it is a simple container running on AWS, CCS, or even if it is a lambda function, and if it is a solo developer working on his own idea, then there is no concept of DevOps, but this product or internal developer platforms are, like, built with things in mind, right? So, there is developers, there is DevOps. And the way this developer, DevOps landscape has evolved was previously, these two groups used to be completely isolated. There is absolutely no collaboration the code, and they simply hand it off to another team, and they take care of building, and then they take care of deploying, and simply they can provide a confirmation back, saying, Yes, we deployed it to so and so environment. Please go ahead and test. Yeah, so. But in between 2020, 13 and 2018 2019 ish, there was a shift of mindset there, saying, Let's make portion of this self service. So self service has been around for a while, to be frank. So what they what happened is a set of tools have been created, like, for example, GitLab, okay, where developer is writing code and then the build automation and deployment automation sat alongside the code that use. That never used to be the case until like these tools came around, Jenkins and GitLab, pipelines, etc. Developers write code, they don't see any automation running immediately as soon as they push the code. Okay, but notice how things have evolved from 2013 to 2019 where developer is making a comment and he's already seeing some automation run. So now developer is exposed to the next steps after development. Okay, so that shift in, or the transformation, has been classically referred to as DevOps, meaning the operations will help developers to experience it, meaning you can commit the code and you will see automation running, and you will be able to know whether the build ran fine or not. That itself is a is one way of self service. So

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
giving control to developers for operations part so operation, but it's a collaboration through a commit or through some way of developers clicking on a button, and that triggers, triggering some other interface. It could be any other interface, but

Swarup Donepudi  9:03  
I can construct that statement is developers, let's collaborate and collaborate or not like the steps after development. That's how I can see it, whether it is clicking a button or pushing a commit. Those are all triggers of how the automation gets triggered, but don't just your role will not end as soon as you commit the

Suresh Attaluri  9:27  
code or push the code. What is the collaboration part here?

Swarup Donepudi  9:30  
So developer will say, Hey, I'm building a Java project. Okay? And DevOps engineers will be like, Okay, let me do some commits to your own repository, which will create the automation. And there is this new wave of tools starting from that 22,010, and beyond, okay, which kind of enabled that whole idea of, okay, two people are collaborating on particular service, yeah, okay, so I would stop the service. I collaborate with you. You kind of make some changes, and you add automation to the repository. Every time I make the changes, you tell me what is going to happen. And as a DevOps engineer, you would come to me and be like, Yeah, as soon as you commit, I made sure that the Build step will run and the test, test step will also run, and they also wrote the automation to automatically deploy something. Yeah, here the collaboration party is definitely developer, is now aware of the like talking to the DevOps that never used to be the case before.

Suresh Attaluri  10:33  
Earlier there was, I mean, the conventional way also has collaboration, but it's more on handovering it to the other team and not caring about how it is put over there. And also, for every release the developer the dev team should have will be dependent, will be dependent on that other team's availability. And they need to schedule a time to deploy their version of the software, software block, they're waiting, they're waiting on the other team. And that's a problem solved 10 years back, and

Swarup Donepudi  11:11  
I was made to solve the problem, and those attempts were have been classically referred to as there should be collaboration. It's not a technology problem, it's a cultural problem. These two groups of teams should not work in isolation. Yeah, let's bring those two teams together, and then a suite of tools kind of entered the market that enhanced this collaboration. And those are the tools that I talked about, Jenkins and these, these don't have any meaning in the previous world where there was no collaboration in the first place. So first culturally, some evolution came around, yeah. And then tools followed, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  11:51  
So this, in this workflow, which you said, with the new tools of DevOps, I see that also, that as well as self service, right, automation has been provided by this DevOps or this operations team developers, is using that automation. I believe that's the high level fund of the whole workflow, yes,

Swarup Donepudi  12:20  
at the same time, something else also started happening, which is adoption of cloud increased and Kubernetes. Adoption of Kubernetes, Kubernetes became the and adoption of cloud increased, adoption of containers increased. Kubernetes became the default de facto container orchestration tool. So what seemed like a good self service solution in 2012 2013 okay? Is that model or framework could not apply to this new shift that was happening, which is okay. What happened when cloud adoption increased is the cacd automation is no longer about just deploying services. These developers now started asking for more. Like, for example, when in data centers, developers never thought about the possibility of requesting for another, say, a volume, okay, so those are all, like, kind of abstracted, those are data centers, and so you, you kind of build and deploy that, then you're talking about static, the

Suresh Attaluri  13:33  
you're talking about the provisioning of infrastructure, right,

Swarup Donepudi  13:38  
okay, not provisioning of infrastructure manages services. So the whole idea of DevOps, when it began, the environments were very static, meaning the organization has one dev environment, right? Like every service that is perceived as dev goes and sits on one piece of infrastructure, and those are long lived, and there is a team who maintains that. Okay? So there is this automation team, release team, used to call it, before DevOps. And then there is infrastructure team. Now with cloud, that infrastructure team itself became less relevant because they are not doing a lot the data center like the cloud abstracted away a lot of those they don't need to maintain, yeah? Like now they are not the clear owners there, yeah, do you even the these people are capable of getting what they need without these the infrastructure experts, right? So now deals can, like request for more, okay, okay, so same, same problem with deploying their own services. They need to deploy their services, but they were asking for mail stream to do it. This. That problem kind of was partially solved with DevOps tooling, where you make a comment, you push it. So that framework applied very well for that, but now cloud, when cloud came around, you could ask for another RDS instance. So it is those, it's not infrastructure. To me, infrastructure, as has always been, more of like, I need compute, I need storage, though, that is infrastructure. Whereas you are asking for a database, is not infrastructure, software infrastructure, maybe so, yeah. Overall, this DevOps CICD started becoming more complex and less efficient for these expanded requirements, with Kubernetes entering into the scene now that became much more like, yeah. I think the whole domain of self service just from being I want a self service just building and deploying my service to some unknown static server, okay, to Okay. I want this self service to also expand to provisioning cloud infrastructure, deploying resources on managed services and deploying services on Kubernetes, etc, etc. What

Suresh Attaluri  16:08  
are managed services? Can you give an example

Swarup Donepudi  16:12  
database on MongoDB, MongoDB a class, okay. Snowflake,

Suresh Attaluri  16:16  
okay. The now these have become the responsibilities of the obscure, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  16:24  
but, but that's that's a bottleneck,

Suresh Attaluri  16:26  
and we haven't talked about how that is being self serve. We only talked about the self service part, where user has to deploy their services, service, build and deploy for those Jenkins and all these tools are there, and self service has been set up. So now we're talking about next side of self service that we expect from ops, which is provisioning, say a database. Say a database. Yeah, provisioning infrastructure is one side. I don't think provisioning infrastructure also has been self service. I think with the cloud, with Cloud employees now that we

Swarup Donepudi  17:12  
are discussing like I I feel like the interesting part that is not very obvious, is I think what happened during this period is also like everything from being the way all of this got created has transformed into becoming an API, course. Okay, yeah, so that actually opened up opportunity for more solutions capabilities. When you can put something behind an API, obviously you can build a front end so ask for anything you want. It can now. It is possible from, say, 2018, and beyond, when Kubernetes started, like becoming more commonplace. COVID is everything is an API. All cloud providers, anything you deploy, is an API. So when there is an API, why can't you build a front end and make the consumption more self service before then nobody can ask for it, because those are not APS getting a database on a virtual machine, or a VMware

Suresh Attaluri  18:25  
or VMware setup. Those

Swarup Donepudi  18:28  
are those technologies are not API friendly. Those

Suresh Attaluri  18:31  
discussions would have happened offline, somehow, like in the same same case, where internal teams, like developers and operations, if they have to communicate, they might have used some emails or any other systems, but there's no automatic system automation.

Swarup Donepudi  18:47  
Nobody thought about it. Nobody can think of it like, since VMware never prioritized building APIs on top of their application, right? They're like, here is a GUI. Your operators can click those buttons and they can get there what they want. Now, make your developer talk to the operator. He clicks the buttons on the UI, he gets it what? But with evolution of cloud and with evolution of Kubernetes, APIs became like a more meaningful way to deploy anything, because that's how stuff gets deployed anyway, whether it is your operator via UI or whether it is Kubernetes, everything is API right when there is APIs, developers can now build a tooling around it,

Suresh Attaluri  19:30  
so now I see again, as opportunity of self service here, Also, like in case of Jenkins or the service layer, be it cloud or not cloud, they can still automate it. They can still put it on there. But the other side of of the spectrum where we are talking about provisioning things, infrastructure or other open source software for managed services Cloud has played a main role in allowing our teams to provide these self service automation Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  20:12  
it became possible. It became possible. So and also again, another on the other side of the spectrum. There is, it is okay to release your software every three months. Was acceptable in 2010 Okay, yeah, come to 2020 unless you're moving at like good pace, your competitors will outsmart you. Like, for example, take plant acloud, right? If we kind of build some one feature in chat bot and release it in next quarter, we are already way behind our next content is always breathing down the neck, right, whether it is passes or COVID, we know that they will set things up for faster development. So we need to also make sure that our development cycles are much, much faster. So the technology landscape itself has become so competitive this the ability for developers to roll out features and build features has become like a critical requirement for businesses. Yes, okay, but how, how can a developer building features for a developer today is not just about writing few lines of code anymore. Like, for example, you built the DevOps like the chat bot, right? You needed Elastic Search at some point, you needed a MongoDB. At some point you deployed our authorization using open FGA unit and a Postgres database. You didn't ask anybody, right? That is how you are able to quickly, kind of make progress, right? Today, to me, that is the reason why there is value for like, more efficient self service capabilities. In order to stay competitive, you need to enable your developers to move fast. And building features is no longer just even I only mentioned about these open source deployments. But think of like if our tech stack is different, and if you are committed to using everything on GCP, right? You would require a memory store, or you would need a storage bucket. So, yeah, I think this is,

Suresh Attaluri  22:29  
I think we established the problem that self service is needed, yeah. I mean, developers can't keep on waiting for other teams to get the get their software requirements ready for them. So, so what is the form of this self service? How? How did this? I mean, there, there is a positive, there is a problem, there is a possibility through cloud. And how did they solve the self service, DevOps? I mean, initially I believe, since we are talking about the journey, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  23:04  
so my observation was like, because I was in DevOps space for during this course of time, and I was seeing firsthand how the tools kind of kept evolved. So I think the first wave of self service was mostly centered around Kubernetes. Kubernetes, Kubernetes, because, because, I think Kubernetes became the de facto, okay, and because Kubernetes is all APIs, but lots and lots

Suresh Attaluri  23:34  
of but what happened before Kubernetes? I think cloud was there cloud was the first thing that came up, right? Like Kubernetes was later point,

Swarup Donepudi  23:45  
same thing as free before Jenkins days. What was only so

Suresh Attaluri  23:50  
similarly, this self service was not fully set up, I believe, or Yeah, people still used to go dependent, depend on the operations there. And

Swarup Donepudi  24:06  
there is a, there are a lot of places where devs are given full control or access to the console console app, and they were asked to create assuming that AWS console itself is a self service dashboard.

Suresh Attaluri  24:20  
Okay, that's yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:22  
you can think of, you can

Suresh Attaluri  24:23  
think of it like, Yeah, but why to wait for the ops people?

Swarup Donepudi  24:28  
Yeah, he has already built

Suresh Attaluri  24:30  
nice uA. I have similar experience in CDK as well. Yeah, we were given the console a cloud account, yeah, and we were asked to create the request. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  24:44  
that is self service, right? What is, what? Ultimately, what the self services let the developers build, what create, what they need to roll out features as fast as possible, yes, without having to understand the intricacies. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  24:59  
Now you're talking about Kubernetes. So how did Kubernetes solve it?

Swarup Donepudi  25:04  
Kubernetes didn't solve the self service. All

Suresh Attaluri  25:07  
of self I was always thinking, Kubernetes is to deploy this service. But when you're when you brought up Kubernetes in this context of deploying other softwares. It's not for services, will, in house services or the software will.

Swarup Donepudi  25:31  
I'm trying to think out loud as to,

yeah, I think I would, I would probably go back and watch the video discussion between the guy Rohit recommended right. Rohit recently recommended that he put us in touch with one person who is a technology analyst in this space, Cloud Platform engineering space, okay, I don't think I can put it anything better than him, okay, so what he was saying was the DevOps self service via like the Jenkins, etc, became complicated and the devs who is wanting just a URL to access I commit code, okay, give me a URL to access my service, yeah, kind of something like that. This was great in pre Jenkins era, where devs give code to ops, and ops say, Yeah, I deployed your WAR file. This is the URL where you can access so he says it was nice back in the day, it was slow, but devs want to focus on writing code. There was an ops team, okay? Who did what they need? They give back the URL.

Suresh Attaluri  27:03  
Okay, so

Swarup Donepudi  27:04  
ultimately, this is a good self service experience, like this is the experience that dev should have, yeah, right. But in 20 as of 2022, this is not the developers experience,

Suresh Attaluri  27:18  
yeah, we are adding more responsibilities to dev developers, yeah, in the Jenkins workflow like,

Swarup Donepudi  27:26  
so this is, again, this is mostly centered around the idea of services like in house built services. In house built Okay, yeah. So they are asking to scale. They are asking to they're being asked to, like, set up, logging, forwarding, all of that. Yeah, I don't think I can put anyway. We established why self service is required in 24 so we'll pause the meeting here, making it a conversation about what is self service, why it is needed. It's just we didn't do anything plant on cloud. So we'll stop here so that I can title the video saying, what is self service DevOps, and then we resume the conversation about, what does it like from building plant on Cloud perspective, how did we we approach providing a good self service experience for developers or on our platform, I think we can directly one, one great way to do that is the console tool itself. This is, this acted as a good guiding reference for me when I was talking about,

Suresh Attaluri  28:37  
yeah, I think in one of our earlier videos we we established this definition of self service. We'll go back and check that one as well the initial videos I was asking you the same questions, what is self service in plant and clouds context? And we will stop this video right now. We'll go back and see that. Okay, I will continue from there. All right. From

there self service on a planet Some Ronnie he discussion,
