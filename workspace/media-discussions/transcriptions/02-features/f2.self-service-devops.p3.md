Okay, I think I don't know if the page is actually structured according to this discussion we have. So the hero section, and then we are, this is the problem statement section,

Suresh Attaluri  0:22  
so,

Swarup Donepudi  0:26  
and we talked about having a video right for problem statement, and I think I have a script. I'm going to tell you the script and tell me if, if you're, like, happy with it. Basically, I explained, I think chatgpt came up with this based on my that explanation, I will be I did this with both Sana and de rich. Basically, orgs will have different maturity levels, providing self service to developers. The first level of maturity is no automation. The best self service they can offer is ticket, ops, meaning dev puts in a ticket for whatever he wants. Ops will do that, okay? And second one is like partial self service. Partial self service, where ops will create modules and put them on GitHub and create documentation. Devs can self service offline, but by learning documentation and stuff like that. Third one is click ops, which is where IDPs. So today these, this is more. This is like becoming the standard click, ops, devs, ops, register, devs come click. The fourth one we are doing is kind of chat ops, same register, but instead of clicking, devs do chat up, so self service DevOps is if you don't have either clickups or ChatOps, if you have this, then people are waiting. Either people are waiting or people are learning. So this is what I'm going to explain in the video. But

Suresh Attaluri  2:15  
how will you demonstrate that? Like ticket ops?

Swarup Donepudi  2:20  
I'm not a concepts, more demos, no

Suresh Attaluri  2:25  
screen will just talk and either

Swarup Donepudi  2:27  
whiteboard or iPad drawing saying same exact

Suresh Attaluri  2:31  
that iPad drawing is nice. Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  2:34  
nicer interface for from quality perspective, this is it, and I have,

Suresh Attaluri  2:40  
I think most of those problems can be shown through that iPad recordings,

Swarup Donepudi  2:48  
yeah, yeah, even that's what I thought. But I think problem statements, we agreed that those will be videos, because we need to explain the concept. So this is the story for self service, DevOps, yes, these are the problems, and in this space, developers are waiting. They're spending lot of time getting blocked due risk. So a high cost of waiting, traditional ticket based systems slowed on progress and frustrated team every minute spent waiting on a process, not spending

Suresh Attaluri  3:18  
innovating substitutes, transforming weeks of waiting into instant action.

Swarup Donepudi  3:22  
Yeah, then here there will be a room video with me in iPad explaining same concept organizations at different maturity levels with plan, if organization can provide, like, high quality, oh, this is just problem space. That's it. So providing an internal developer platform for developers to enable self service is a good solution. That's it. We'll end the meeting there. Say goodbye to delays and dependencies. So this is where I think it begins unleash the power of self service. Say goodbye to delays

Suresh Attaluri  3:59  
for all other. I don't know if you have any pattern, but we are showing those sections of ISC. Like here, we decided there are three categories, yeah, IC modules, cookie cutter and CICD templates, yeah, those should be sections, sections, right? I'll

Swarup Donepudi  4:19  
redo this page.

Suresh Attaluri  4:22  
I think it's okay to have smaller pages rather than, I think at this point we can incrementally, always add things, more sections to it. But let's do that organically, that when something comes up, then we can add it rather than, I think,

Swarup Donepudi  4:39  
self service, DevOps. Fourth part will be operations.

Operations will simply talk about, do we have the Kubernetes dashboard? Right? We will not again. Will incrementally add, if we feel it right, right now, you're right. Don't want to get too greedy and make this very, extremely difficult for us. You want to keep these pages simple and at least get get past the definition of

Suresh Attaluri  5:12  
dumpling. So right now, I only see one section coming up over there. Yeah. ISC modules, yeah. But, and we'll, we'll add a screenshot of those module templates, templates

Swarup Donepudi  5:30  
the high cost of waiting, okay, and maybe unleash the power of self service platform. Maybe, maybe here this section can stay, and we'll have screenshots of,

Suresh Attaluri  5:47  
how about this? Unleash the power of self service DevOps. Okay, like here you said about arcs, this ticket ops and partial self service thing, right? That's the problem part of here we can put another video and explain how click ops and chart ops bring difference. Okay, yeah, still no platform being shown. But

and next would be this IAC module section, okay, where we can show we can add this point of we can add a screenshot of our platform with those rich modules, existing modules

Swarup Donepudi  6:43  
at to redo this page. I think we're the reason why we are having difficulty is we are not talking about a specific section titled in a certain way. So but for me, the action item would be to redo this page by only adding sections around the Self Service DevOps around, I think AC modules, cookie cutter template, CAC templates. When

Suresh Attaluri  7:06  
this was made, there was not be a clear definition of self service DevOps. And I believe the other video which you saw, yeah, I

Swarup Donepudi  7:15  
think I asked chatgpt, I'm going to tell you all about the product, you can tell me, or you can create sections from self service doors, because, again, there was no clear definition there. So I'll redo this page only with minimal sections, IAC modules, cookie cutter templates and CAC templates. And for each of them, we'll just put screenshots of the pulumi registry and deployment component screenshots. IAC cookie cutter template, screenshots, GitHub actions and get

Suresh Attaluri  7:44  
a workflow screenshot. We have those

Swarup Donepudi  7:48  
history, and we'll just line, write one or two liners, no videos, nothing. Will close the page, and I'll remove everything else that is not relevant. And at the end, I'll simply say, Yeah, this is like lot of unneeded stuff on this page. Yeah, is not very well done. So okay, cool. Did we didn't talk about the videos for particular templates, and this because we don't have them working yet, yeah? So we will not add it. Yes, we'll do the only add one video where we are only showing the IAC modules. Part. Will not add even the tiles for tabs for these. We'll add it when we have it.

Suresh Attaluri  8:33  
Or we can add and just say, coming soon.

Swarup Donepudi  8:35  
Yeah, we can do that

Suresh Attaluri  8:38  
list as a placeholders. Or

Swarup Donepudi  8:40  
maybe I can record a video where I can simply show, here is the service of here is the CICD template library. Here the action CICD templates can be registered. And we are working on adding, adding the ability to configure your service repositories to add these, yes, and here is the list of cookie cutter templates available. And if the work is completed by the time we record the video, we'll say it's this is how you do it. If not, this is coming soon, yeah. And then the page will have three small sections, one talking about IAC modules and one talking about cookie cutter one talking about CACT templates. I'll do console app tour when all of this is implemented, and then come up with the page sections once again. Then, okay, that concludes the Self Service media discussions. I

Suresh Attaluri  10:17  
i demos you immediate.
