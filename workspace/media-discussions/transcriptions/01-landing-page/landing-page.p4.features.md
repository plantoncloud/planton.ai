Swarup Donepudi  0:00  
This. Okay, so, continuing the previous discussion, where we talked about, what did we talk about? Yeah, the illustration, illustration for the internal developer platform. So we decided that the hero section is good, and we discussed what changes are needed for this animation, and then followed up with the same GitHub like illustration video, not for different forms, yeah, not directly the illustration video. First, we will have these kind, this kind of categorization. And we talked about what to show in each of the categories. We recorded that as one video, and then we moved on to the next step, the product definition section, and that is this guy. Also

Suresh Attaluri  1:05  
we discussed what should be visual representation,

Swarup Donepudi  1:08  
without and with and platform engineers and developers, etc, so, and we agreed that we will continue discussing just the landing page and finalize what needs to be shown here, and then, what is this section? So this is more sub features for this section. So every page section have some subsections,

Suresh Attaluri  1:35  
so final content will

Swarup Donepudi  1:40  
Yeah, so, final content, landing page, final page. Final landing page, looking at the so each of these is a section. In every section had a title and, okay, yeah, a subtitle and some key points. Okay, so those are what if you have used to generate these sections. So that was the title and description for problem definition, and this is like the

Suresh Attaluri  2:16  
key points subsection for

Swarup Donepudi  2:19  
internal level, the same product. So you get unified operations, you are empowering teams with a driven self service capabilities and simplified workflows, complex DevOps tasks, because due to conversations,

Suresh Attaluri  2:33  
I believe these points will also be given by chatgpt, right? These were earlier. It was given by chatgpt, but considering the discussion that we had in the morning, these points might change.

Swarup Donepudi  2:49  
That is additional work we

Suresh Attaluri  2:52  
keep the same, yeah. So

Swarup Donepudi  2:56  
for now, I believe the bigger hurdle to cross or get over, is the media okay? Like, even still, keeping this without changing this, we can actually launch the website, and then we'll have the full website working, and we'll come back and be like, Oh, this doesn't make sense. Use this space to tell different story. We can iterate for No, yeah. And the fact that right now in this page, no animation is needed, like no media is required, right? This looks good. That's fine. They'll read it and keep going for down. And these are, like, again, this is where the features begin. So going back, so these, this is the feature section, and this maps to the drop down features part. Yeah. We are now going one after the other. So plantora, the AI power DevOps co pilot, revolutionizing DevOps workflow with and then there will be a Learn More button, which will take to the full dedicated page. Okay, okay. And this is the area that we have to for media. So he put some random part, yeah, and we have an opportunity to either create a GIF and also maybe put something like watch video, whatever. So that is what we need to discuss right now, and five guys

Suresh Attaluri  4:24  
and any media, the first easiest form of making content is video or video,

Swarup Donepudi  4:30  
screen recording, screen recording. And for plantora, for us, making a video is very easy because you simply say, we'll start the video. And perfection is not the goal. Any video will do the job. Okay? So we will basically need to finalize the script for what

Suresh Attaluri  4:53  
we want to show so we are sure that it will be a screen recording or a slash video,

Swarup Donepudi  4:58  
yeah, and

Suresh Attaluri  5:01  
what it will be having.

Swarup Donepudi  5:03  
How about so? Or we can also have something like like this, like the chat window with some conversation, which is also a screenshot. Just like this, is a screenshot of quick chat we can have in conversation.

Suresh Attaluri  5:17  
The earlier content or media that we discussed shows how you how

Suresh Attaluri  5:24  
that is, how one can build

Suresh Attaluri  5:26  
through chat, someone can deploy and all those stuff, right? So, recordings are already there. Here we can put some nice chat image, an existing chart. We can take a screenshot, yeah, along with stack jobs or logs, or with or without it? Yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  5:45  
And we can also create a simple GIF by like, doing the typing. So we'll have a chat that we want to show, and we'll do the chat and create a GIF out of it and put it here. It's not a video.

Suresh Attaluri  6:00  
How about simply creating a Redis Kuber Redis instance on Kubernetes, the whole journey? Yeah, from, from the point where user asks for or mentioned expresses his intent to create an instance.

Swarup Donepudi  6:15  
So that will be a GIF, and then we'll have a button to say, Watch video. Where? What does watch videos? Watch video is more deeper explanation. Me explaining so. So when, when it is GIF, they may seem though it graphics or whatever, but when we are doing a video, we have more time. If they have clicked on watch video, that means they have, like, we have their attention, so we have the luxury of additional few minutes to explain some stuff around it. Like, yeah, this is a bot. It is capable of doing this because it is for all plant owner, right? The first image will only show that Redis part, but we can also explain what it is capable of. Like, you can invite user. You can do that. You can do things.

Suresh Attaluri  7:07  
So do you think that we need to put the video here or the actual full feature page, which has the whole

Swarup Donepudi  7:13  
so just a link for that is fine here, and maybe on the full feature page in the hero section below the section, will have like a thumb, large thumb, which plays the video itself. So that is another option. Also one of the theme that you will probably come across on the website is repeated content, meaning it's also inspired from GitHub, where GitHub kind of tells the same story over and over again in a different context. Yeah, plan to wrap. And if you go to their enterprise page, it says, plan Torah is a sensory so it meets your enterprise capability. So I saw the team and we implemented that.

Suresh Attaluri  7:54  
So here we have two links. One is, learn more about

Swarup Donepudi  7:58  
discover plantora, plantora and then watch video. Yeah, and watch video will open the same video as the the video that we are going to put on the hero section of the dedicated plant or a page. Or, instead of going there and learning that there is a video, we also put a video small link to directly watch TV.

Suresh Attaluri  8:22  
Yeah, I think that covers election, right? Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  8:25  
self service DevOps breaking free from DevOps bottlenecks. So here also the simpler ones are always definitely the video.

Suresh Attaluri  8:36  
I see some overlap between the planter and self service DevOps as a functionality, functionality,

Swarup Donepudi  8:42  
yes,

Suresh Attaluri  8:46  
how will you demo a self service DevOps in our product? That is the question.

Swarup Donepudi  8:59  
Yeah, these are two narratives. One is with or without plantara. There is self service. But first part we are saying, we are basically showing off the congregational capabilities, which is obviously a powerful feature. And then we are telling about self service DevOps, okay, explicitly talking about that value proposition. So for me, how do I do that? Is probably again, another video where we don't we are not going to do planta at all. Okay, in this one, we are going to say, hey, here is the deployment store you can browse. You can deploy. Here is a service ministry you can explore. So we are basically giving them a tour of the website, like the console app from a self serving perspective. Okay? Because chat will not give them a chance to see what what is all available, right? It's like a question and answer and chat is not 100% capable of doing everything that is possible, right? So, for example, I want to see this tag job history, or I want to go and, yeah, personally, I don't know.

Suresh Attaluri  10:23  
Basically self service DevOps, something which developer does without platform engineers, right? That is

Swarup Donepudi  10:34  
a yeah, that is the meaning of self service. And

Suresh Attaluri  10:41  
how do we do that is

Swarup Donepudi  10:43  
maybe with and without. We can talk about in the video,

Suresh Attaluri  10:47  
with and without, also we can talk we morning we were discussing about that is

Swarup Donepudi  10:51  
with and without internal developer platform and without the self serving capabilities. What can happen is developer needs to talk to pops engineer, which plant or a developer can self service? That's the narrative that we are showing on IDP as well. I think we can talk about it in the video itself. We're saying, Hey, your platform engineers can create the infrastructure and register them in the programming module, and you can consume it. And that is what we built it you are self serving your requirements. So these

Suresh Attaluri  11:25  
guys, platform engineers, are writing these modules and making it available for

Swarup Donepudi  11:31  
developers to self service, for

Suresh Attaluri  11:35  
them to be self service. So that's what is in our platforms context, self service is providing that framework, yeah, where these platform engineers are able to put something and the other guys were able to consume it? Yes, so I think we can do the information that

Swarup Donepudi  11:52  
we are, yeah, no. Quantum chat, like, then that's a new capability. You don't have to learn user interfaces. You don't have to learn what, where is what? So that is what we emphasize in plant or context. But when it comes to self service, we are emphasizing more on like platform engineer, we are make creating the framework the platform engineers interact with this and like provide the self service options, and developers consume their self service options. Yes, so yeah, the script for here is definitely covering the ability for senior engineers to register cookie cutter templates in the library, or the ability for DevOps engineers to register their actions and workflows in the same library, and ability for platform engineers to register TerraForm or pulumi modules in the registry, and all of them are consumable for developers, so that they can now no longer have to talk to anyone in the organization to consume that automation that is developed. They can self service their request whenever they want. So this is the story. I think this is good, right? I think since we are recording all of this, this becomes, this comes as a script, and chatgpt will tell me what to do during that recording. And as for the image, I think we'll try and ask IR Shah to say, this is the narrative, the same story.

Suresh Attaluri  13:24  
We can't tell you everything in a jiffy and video form. Videos, I don't think we at hero section. People would like to have a hero section, I don't know, because video is something which someone has to click. And

Swarup Donepudi  13:39  
I mean more the full feature pages,

Suresh Attaluri  13:42  
you know? Videos, I don't know if they are,

Swarup Donepudi  13:48  
yeah, so right content to all videos most likely are going to be like watch video.

Suresh Attaluri  13:55  
We either show a screen recording with autoplay. I think we

Swarup Donepudi  13:57  
established maybe this can become a pattern itself, where this video is the same video that is going to play as the hero section video, yes, the dedicated feature page. I think

Suresh Attaluri  14:08  
that's good. But what do we put on the hero section of this?

Swarup Donepudi  14:11  
I think we I think the scripts for the videos are a good input for insha to decide some kind of animation, illustration. Okay, first, we'll make the video for self service. We'll give the script to Isha and say, Hey, can you do something? Can you create an illustration using any technology or stuff like that? Can you do that? And we'll ask, okay, so, yeah, first step is to definitely, for each of these feature pages, videos are necessary which will be linked to next to these, those videos will also be added as the main element on the dedicated pages. And as for what, what should be the graphic. It can be in case of self service, it's a concept. So you cannot do a screenshot

Suresh Attaluri  15:08  
of the app, yeah, we can also screenshots or something.

Swarup Donepudi  15:10  
Yeah, we'll let yourself decide, because we'll have the video script after that. So I think this is also good,

Suresh Attaluri  15:19  
yeah, yeah. We'll

Swarup Donepudi  15:21  
continue next. okay, this is good conversation.
