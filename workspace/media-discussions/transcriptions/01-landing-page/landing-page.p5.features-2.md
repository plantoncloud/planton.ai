Unknown Speaker  0:38  
Okay, so I'll Start

Unknown Speaker  0:45  
Recording. Oh, looks like these two cameras are different.

Unknown Speaker  0:47  
Yeah, right, yes,

Swarup Donepudi  0:57  
what I think you had this field.

Alright? So let's continue the discussion of the landing page sections. So I think we went until we got past the product definition section. We agreed that this is going to have the illustration with before, without and with plan down cloud, with platform engineers, developers and senior engineers creating cookie cutter templates, etc. And we agreed that these text sections will not have any media and and then we moved on to the Features section for plant Ara. We agreed that we'll have one GIF or multiple screenshots showing multiple chats. And and I think we also dive, dive somewhat deep into like, what should that content be? What should those screenshots be like? I think I don't remember we discussing it, but I think we ended up agreeing that we create a loom recording explaining plant aura features or capabilities, and add a link alongside discover to watch video. We'll make sure the video watch video pops up, because that helps the visitors get more understanding. And we also talked about the script for the video itself, where we can begin with deploying genes database on Kubernetes and show the stack job progress and then update it and show the version diff and also, finally, probably destroyed, maybe during the demo. Or we can also do a couple cloud resources to make sure that it's not just for Kubernetes, because there is so many products that are being just Kubernetes, but our capabilities are that we can demonstrate multi cloud. It's easy to create a ngcs bucket. It's easy to create a route 53 zone. These are all like resources that can be created very quickly. So I think the script for this video can be like to demonstrate the wild capabilities. It can begin with inviting a user, saying that we can invite users which has nothing to do with deployments or anything, and then we can move on to talking about deploying. We should begin with deploying something on AWS and then GCP, okay, these are the only two clouds we currently support. So I think we can deploy, I think route 53 zone and a GCS bucket. These two are like lightweight resources, and we can probably, maybe, in fact, instead of Route 53 we can actually deploy a VPC. We'll

Suresh Attaluri  4:26  
do a test, because we haven't discussed about the video script yet. That is what I decided to write down. We decided we'll do that when we discuss about the feature complete feature page, okay, okay. And this one we thought, we thought of having few screenshots of plant and plant

Swarup Donepudi  4:46  
borough, okay, yeah, what should those screenshots be? Or should they? I think same thing in screenshots. I guess so, same story, same story that we tell in the video, I think we don't have to innovate on what screenshots to show. The same chat conversations that are shown in the video can be taken, and maybe what do you call the tech collage of those chats can be created, and you shall can probably innovate on how to place those images and stuff. I think those can also be like small text. It doesn't have to be like a pretty big chat at

Suresh Attaluri  5:31  
a high level. The message that you would like to convey with them, with screenshots is you can reach out to plantora, not to platform engineer, get your work done. Yeah, that's the message I've been trying to

Swarup Donepudi  5:47  
Yeah. So the conversations will be as if they're talking to a platform. Platform engineer, hey, plant or I need a Redis Database for my app, and then yeah, the bot will respond, maybe we can even update plant or to behave like platform engineer, like I'm Hey, I'm here, like I have expertise in I'm an expert platform engineer. Ask me what you want to so I think that is a much better branding. I think so instead of simply saying, hey, yeah, I can help you with that. It can tell itself that, hey, I've done many things in platform engineering, yeah. So yeah, I'm this is certainly something that I can help you with. And then it can, like, start dating.

Suresh Attaluri  6:35  
That's the benefit from plant or right, like you, if someone is using plant or,

Swarup Donepudi  6:41  
yeah, no, I'm saying from a sales or marketing tactic perspective, plantora is a term that we introduced as a name for the bot. Instead of calling it a co pilot, right? We knew that it's a new word that we are introducing at the same time. I think we can leverage that to say plantora. Who is plantora, is an experienced platform engineer, yes, available, 24/7, right? I think, because my part

Suresh Attaluri  7:08  
is, what is plant or doing is it is reducing your support tickets, which actually used to be done by platform

Swarup Donepudi  7:17  
engineer? Yeah, exactly. That's the value. But if I want to tell who what is plant Ara, then I'm I just want to say, okay, platform engineer 24/7 on YouTube, it has on duty 24 which has

Suresh Attaluri  7:31  
same intelligence. Do what platform engineers

Swarup Donepudi  7:34  
can do for that can do for you? Yeah. Plant Ara is platform will be made on duty 24 by seven. I think those are the lines that we need to put on like website, right? I think the planter page itself has like the hero section, right? So instead of saying like, I think the right now plan to IA, the page says something like, transform DevOps with conversational instant. We can say, hey, I'm your platform engineer on duty. 24 duty, yeah, I think that's and then we will do the watch video, or maybe for here, we will not do watch video. We will embed the video right here. Okay, we'll move jump from landing page to this one. So let's go back. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  8:25  
we'll come back to the script of video

Swarup Donepudi  8:27  
when we are discussing the full feature page, full page. Okay, I think self service DevOps also we talked about it, yeah, and we said this one, it's hard to demonstrate with.

Suresh Attaluri  8:40  
Will show the deployment, store and Service Hubs, yeah, where platform engineers can cook some modules, or

Swarup Donepudi  8:51  
those are all difficult to make and you cannot I'll talk about video or image, video, yeah, video. We'll talk about video,

Suresh Attaluri  9:03  
screenshots or the GIFs that we are going to put it here is, is around the deployment, stores and service. That's how I'm looking at Yeah, so that one guy is putting it here, and the other developers can self service using them.

Swarup Donepudi  9:21  
Okay, yeah, so I think the story that we are going to tell you in the DevOps video is around like senior for when it comes to service development. So senior engineers can publish templates. Other engineers can create bootstrap quickly using those templates, and DevOps engineers or CICD engineers can publish GitHub actions and workflows. The engineers can add them when they want to their services from the library and platform. Engineers can publish infrastructure modules for provisioning cloud, infra, deploying open source, and the developers can self service via deployment store and pulumi registry. Yeah, I think that's a good story.

Suresh Attaluri  10:04  
What we're talking we're going to talk about registry, pulumi registry, when we say self service, DevOps,

Speaker 1  10:12  
service hub, also service hub for discovered, discovery and bootstrapping

Swarup Donepudi  10:17  
service hub. So

Speaker 2  10:19  
registry, development, deployment, store, and there

Swarup Donepudi  10:22  
is a source code templates library which shows cookie cutter templates, GitHub actions and workflows all in one place. So that is for service part, and this library right and deployment component, store and programming module existing for like the infrastructure modules, like provisioning part,

Suresh Attaluri  10:44  
yeah. So that part side of the product, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  10:46  
So I know we will demonstrate the same script inside the video itself. So I think the theme that we can establish is whatever we are going to explain in the video itself is what is going to drive what we will put here. Because you tell the same story, giving you a glimpse, and when you jump into the

Suresh Attaluri  11:04  
script has to be discussed in more detail, but, but the theme is theme that we are the part of the product that we are going to show as

Swarup Donepudi  11:17  
this history Like there are three parties involved. Who is getting self service is the developer platform engineers and senior engineers are enabling that self service by

Suresh Attaluri  11:29  
publishing how, how, even without plant and clone, that self service can be done right? Like they can still have GitHub and all those other tools, yeah, but what how plant and clone is enabling it is using columi registries. Yeah, that the frames,

Swarup Donepudi  11:47  
it's hard to again, represent all of that information in that image, so, but now that all of this conversation is being captured. But I get your point. And I think it's valuable if we can, like, right, if we can find people who can help us create a visualization that that conveys the message that without plant on Cloud, enabling self service is is a lot more work. There is no central place where developers and platform engineers come and collaborate. There are multiple tools, and there is a lot of documentation that is that would be required to make that self service happen. So it's it's not, it's substandard. There is so the success rate of adopting that self, like all the Self Service intended work will not be, will not reach its target customers, and the productivity gains will be lost because of because of the fact that all of this self service automation is splintered across very like a wide number of tools plant over is bringing all of that to one place where we are providing module to history, deployment component store for both pulumi and TerraForm modules. It can we are doing a registry, and we are providing source code templates library where they can publish GitHub actions, GitHub workflows, GitLab, that is Jenkins, any reusable CICD or service template bootstrapping is all in one place. So I think, yeah, I think you got that nice point where when we talk about what we build, it's important to clearly articulate why we built those, right? So I think the biggest reason is definitely the fact that today, to enable the same self service, there are multiple tools that developers or self service providers or self service consumers need to jump around, which reduces the overall like value that gets delivered with that self service. And we are particularly solving that problem by creating these centralized repositories, like deployment store pulumi module, sorry, in IAC module Registry, or which contains both TerraForm and pulumi modules that are offered maintained by Platinum cloud or the organizations can bring their own and also source code template libraries, again, containing GitHub workflows or cookie cutter templates or GitHub workflows, again, both maintain there. You'll find a lot of the registered ones maintained by plant upload or the organization can bring their own. So yeah, we are creating or making that consuming and providing self service very easy. So it's not, we are not the creators of self service. It's it's a wrong claim to say that we are the first ones to enable self service. We simplified the self service, and we are making the success, increasing the success rate of the intended goal for those self service initiatives, and making the improving the overall quality of life. People call this as quality of life improvements, because it's hard to measure it right then, yeah. Also,

Suresh Attaluri  15:07  
I would like to highlight that there is very low status Q to adapt to this our platform, because we still have those GitHub report like, yeah, talking about.

Swarup Donepudi  15:21  
So you are referring to my one of the point that I learned in the sales pitch, that the biggest competitor is the status quo

Suresh Attaluri  15:31  
solution. So, so when we talk about pulumi registry, we still the underlying repositories are nothing

Swarup Donepudi  15:40  
but a GitHub repository. So GitHub acts as a plumbing history.

Suresh Attaluri  15:44  
So, what, how, what, how and what planet load is. It is just segregating all that information.

Swarup Donepudi  15:52  
Is creating a central

Unknown Speaker  15:55  
place to

Swarup Donepudi  15:56  
collaborate and yeah, so that, yeah, I think we never discussed this aspect of plant town right now that we are focusing on zooming in on, like self service. I think the first conversation I remember you asking me, what is self service, DevOps? I don't understand it. Almost a year ago, exactly a year ago, yes, and we have come, come very long, where we are clearly articulating what is the self service portion of platforms.

Unknown Speaker  16:29  
Okay? So, yeah, this is all good,

Swarup Donepudi  16:33  
okay, service hub and same thing, yeah, here is the media part.

Suresh Attaluri  16:38  
Oh, now, do you think we still need the service hub here?

Swarup Donepudi  16:43  
I believe so. Service hub is the reason why we are promoting service hub a lot is, again, to convey our commitment towards service development, which is like 80% of the work that devs do every day. So while self service develops as a lot like infrastructure provisioning this, that, but, but service development itself is, is, is what where, like developers and companies, are struggling a lot they, although the difficulties in in provisioning cloud infrastructure or deploying open source are kind of slowing down and creating like overall service development, and they are the ones impacting but people, it's hard for us to put the seller like sell that narrative. We want to say we are this is a place where you can also develop services. We are providing a lot more features around service development itself, like, for example, when I when I say self service DevOps, I don't dive much deeper into creating a dot env file. Okay? So that is the reason so we have a dedicated page to talk about all those features that we are specifically developing for service development itself, yeah, yeah, but as a continuation, probably, yeah, I see your point that,

Suresh Attaluri  18:09  
yeah. But also see your point that you can't just hide service hub is such a big thing. Yeah, exactly. You can't just hide it under service, service and for planned and club customers as well. Service hub maintaining services is the biggest, biggest portion of their pain point. So, yeah, definitely we need to highlight so this is,

Swarup Donepudi  18:31  
it's not like we are, like changing we are providing like, crazy amount of value here. Self Service dogs, yes, service hub is like an essential thing. So that is what we are saying. We are putting it out there that we are also doing the essential part. It's self service DevOps, we are like improving the overall quality of life, because others don't do it. But if you use this, you come to this place to for that overall quality of life improvements. You will also be provided with lots of tooling around service development, by providing you discovery, by giving you secrets management, configuration management for services, all of that local development, rtnv generation, and we are going to add more, like observability is only mostly for applies to this guy. So with the CICD side

Unknown Speaker  19:24  
of it also, yeah, exactly, yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  19:25  
So what do you think the media should be for media? Oh, this

Swarup Donepudi  19:31  
one, this one. This one begins with the bootstrapping a new micro service from a template that is where. So when we showed self service DevOps, we won't dive into how to create template, how to publish the template, etc. We'll simply include that small portion in the self service DevOps narrative, because from it, from the lens of self serviceness, like engineers can publish, developers can consume. We won't zoom into what those templates are, how the those are consumed, etc. But here we can directly open service, click on Bootstrap and choose one of the templates, and then add cacd to that, and then deploy it as a micro service, or a fargate service, or a ECS service or a lambda service. Show that and how it relates to stack jobs. So relating it to stack jobs is not the important part. We just have to demonstrate that this platform is capable of helping developers, onboarding developers fairly quickly by helping them discover all the registry of services, of previously created services. And it can also help them understand quickly like create a new service and then get going quickly. So bootstrapping to production or lower environments is much quicker. Again, we are not claiming that we are the ones who put it first, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  20:55  
So at a high level, we'll go through the journey of bootstrapping, building and deploying, yeah, or operate as well, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  21:04  
if it is a Kubernetes service for now, operating will add more via actions, as we talked in our previous sessions here, but yeah, for now, show the operations part for Kubernetes services only

Suresh Attaluri  21:18  
at a high level. Let's assume that we have, we'll have multiple screenshots put out here. Yeah, all these elements of building bootstrapping, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  21:27  
maybe, maybe even other things, even a journey animation will also not animation, a simple like Journey diagram, like bootstraps are nice.

Suresh Attaluri  21:37  
Also, I don't know if it will be at the top. Also, we decided we'll show how the build part, bootstrap part and provisioning, like yesterday we have written those categories, so yeah, but okay,

Swarup Donepudi  21:53  
we'll see. We'll see. Yeah, I think again, repetition is okay, no,

Suresh Attaluri  21:58  
but that will be more of a GIF and more media content, which is, that's how we are imagined or we discussed. This

Swarup Donepudi  22:08  
is more lengthy version explaining for taking more like five minutes of time creating a video up there. It's not going to be videos.

Speaker 2  22:17  
It's going to be a couple screenshots with GIFs. Here it will be screenshots.

Swarup Donepudi  22:21  
Yeah, it will be screenshot. Or, I'm saying because this is service hub, we can also show like Bootstrap, setup, CICD, deploy, operate, and we can probably say, discover, service hub, build GitHub, actions and workflows. We will do some type of diagram or screenshots. I think the easier work is definitely screenshot. So we'll shoot for that, like, take semi sub screenshot.

Suresh Attaluri  22:46  
Yeah, one thing that I'm realizing is, if we figure out the video part, then we will get, yeah, I think to know what should be put on the landing page section. Yes,

Swarup Donepudi  22:57  
I think we will do the videos, videos first, and then we will do work on these, like whatever images we want here, because videos will now, the videos will definitely carve out the scope for the story that we are telling, and obviously that is the story that we want to visually represent here. So I think once we have the video nailed down, I think we can then talk about what should be the image format, yes,

Suresh Attaluri  23:25  
okay, integrate, but yeah, but at a high level, we know what has to be represented as this feature service of Yeah, yes. Next is integrated IAC workflows, deployment simplified.

Swarup Donepudi  23:44  
So this is built in infrastructure as code, is what we want to say, just like we said self service DevOps from a self service perspective, like everything. And then we talked about the importance of the 80% of work that people do, which is like creating services, deploying them, etc, and then we say, Okay, now you got most of to do, which is, you have open source deployments, you have cloud infrastructure, your managed services. And for all that, you need infrastructure as code. And we have simplified that which is integrated, Ise workflows.

Speaker 2  24:21  
So what, which part of the product are we going

Swarup Donepudi  24:26  
to so this is all about. So here we just like the way I said, in service of, I will begin my journey with showing service of, service of Bootstrap, bootstrap cell phone, of the cookie cutter templates create the repository, add GitHub action, and then deploy by adding it customized micro service, and then operate by so that completes the slide. This when, when we talk about integrated IAC workflows, we are going to explain that we begin our journey with the deployment store. Okay, okay, these are all the things for which ISC modules have been already created, and you can either choose to run pulumi or TerraForm. Let's say we let's imagine that TerraForm is already ready by then, and then, if it is not ready, we say pulumi is already there. TerraForm integration is coming soon, and what you can do is you can click on that, and here are all the attributes, and when you click on it, instantly, pulumi preview apply is created, and the stack jobs history is there, and every change is captured as version history. All the configuration changes. And here is the pulumi module registry. And if you want customizations, you can create your own pulumi module registers here, and we will show stack job settings where you can configure either at organization level. We'll talk about how to configure pulumi back and and, yeah, all of that. So basically, so there is a lot to tell here, and the scope is, how do you do IAC with random code? And we maybe you can also apply the same philosophy of with and without, like, how would you achieve the same thing without? Maybe we can talk briefly about that, or do a whiteboard in the same recording, explaining, if, let's imagine a life where you don't have anything like plant and cloud, then your developers would sorry, platform engineers would publish these on GitHub and document it on, say, Confluence and and your developers will search on Confluence as if there is a module, etc. If there is, then how do you they consume it is, they create a repository, and they set up their own cacd. And all of those steps are now condensed into much simpler self service developer experience, where they can explore what is available in the store and and they can. They don't have to do any customer like CICD setup. They can. We are not abstracting anything. They can still do that. We have created GitHub actions to create film like CICD for these also like, you can put your configuration in a git repository and add a GitHub action so that whenever you make the configuration change, if you like that workflow, Git workflow, you make a configuration change commit, but you'll have to add, like, the CICD for it, or there is one available in the this template, so on, so forth. Yeah.

Suresh Attaluri  27:28  
So by integrated ISC workflows, you're saying that you give us some config and that will automatically trigger a workflow, yeah. So that workflow is nothing, but we deploy something for

Swarup Donepudi  27:41  
us is the preview apply the

Suresh Attaluri  27:45  
steps of stack job. Stack job will be started. So, yeah, same thing in GitHub. You need to modify the configs, which is now changed to a form.

Swarup Donepudi  27:56  
Again, that's what we so this is a an alternative, but they can still achieve the same thing via GitHub also, yeah, like they can put the Redis configuration in a GitHub repository. They make the change from saying 3.5 G to 4.4 G as the disk size, and they get commit, push, and action gets triggered that does not apply with hyphen T for following the stack job progress. And this is the stack job progressing. So we are not taking away that ability if you if that is what you are into, we still like provide value, because whatever is being deployed from any git repository surfaces as history here, so auditing and all those capabilities are still valuable.

Suresh Attaluri  28:41  
So the only change is if, without plant and cloud, they need to figure out the module TerraForm or coronavi module that they have to apply to this configuration that they are providing, or they have to figure out what is

Swarup Donepudi  29:01  
and then the generality part is the visibility or transparency, like, which modules have been created by whom, where are they published? What is the like washing and how do you consume that? What are the steps involved in consuming side things and what, what infrastructure got created and who created them? So these are difficult questions to find answers for in growing companies, in general and larger companies, it becomes even difficult. So we are solving the problem of creating the automation and share publishing the automation in the first place, right? And then we are also solving, somewhat improving the overall quality of life for developers to discover that automation and consume that automation, right? So that is, and Kubernetes dashboard. This is for, again, mostly highlighting what that we did, but as a feature set, I think, yeah, actually, this falls under the operation part, yeah, yeah. So it's not only for services, right? So you deploy a Redis, or you deploy Mongo, it's in those are not maybe we thought we'll put the also, those also in services up. But for now, you can, if it's fair to say, you deploy anything on the Kubernetes Oh, well, you can. So there is actually a lot more to Kubernetes than just services. Like, for example, you deploy GKs cluster, you can have access to the entire GK cluster dashboard. Again, this is not, we didn't invent this, but this is more around application oriented Kubernetes visualizations, so meaning, you deploy your services, you deploy MongoDB, whatever, right? You are only going to see the resources that are created for it, etc, etc. So while Kubernetes dashboard, it's difficult for developers to navigate and find what they want. Now we have integrated Kubernetes, simplified Kubernetes dashboard around the deployed services. Okay, while we are also providing cluster level resources, like all namespaces, all resources is more for cluster administrators and administration, but this is more for more valuable for like individual developers who deploy services, they get immediate, instant access to that. So we want to highlight it. We don't want to hide it again under the service. That's the intention here. And again, we will decide the image that we are going to put after we create the video. And video is pretty straightforward there. We can simply show what is available, like the all the features. Like you can edit you can look up all the Kubernetes resources created for your service. You can edit them. You can stream logs for your pods. You can exec into the containers. So these are like the first straightforward, straightforward value, value giving feature. So we'll demonstrate those, and we'll do the same screenshots here. I think that's good. Okay, I think it's 31 minutes. Will this is the last one. I guess our last two. Will continue them later. Okay, do you have any concluding notes here? Or are you good? I
