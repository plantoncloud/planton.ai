Swarup Donepudi  0:02  
Okay, so I'm with Suresh, and we both are going to review, start reviewing the website content, the sales website content for plant run.ai, and the current designs that if shell has put together already, and the purpose of this discussion is so right now, the work that is still pending and needs to be get done for the website to be fully built out, is the media meaning. Because this is a new product, there is obviously a lot of new terms that we introduced, which we averted as much as possible. We didn't want to introduce any new words keep like because of the fact that new terminology requires education so and the important part is the sales website is for positioning in the market. Like, what do we want the market to think of us? And website plays a critical role. It is the tool that helps us get that positioning across to the market. And we felt like ever since we built plant or as a DevOps co pilot, we felt like That should be the face of the product, meaning we changed our positioning from calling ourselves as an internal development platform to being a conversational DevOps platform, while the category still remains to be an internal developer platform, well, there is a lot of other people who are calling themselves as internal developer platform. So we need to position. We need to adjust our positioning so that we kind of stand out and so and again, what is pending is, although we added various sections to this each each page, there is section title and and then there is some brief discussion description About the section, while this may definitely give some idea to our target audience, it may also not fully make sense, and because we feel like we are trying shooting for product led growth, meaning we think we have built up Great product, and which means if we can give the glimpse of the best features of the product fairly quickly, and make it very easy for somebody to know about those awesome, awesome things, at least in our perception, those are awesome features, and we we strongly believe that for us, product led growth is possible because of the quality of the product that we have put together, and these section titles and section descriptions will not help us achieve that goal of educating the visitors of this website to quickly understand the quality or the value proposition that the product has to offer. And for that to happen, the only next thing is for them to sign up and see that in action. But obviously users are not going to do it, so we want to make it very easy for them to get a glimpse. And the purpose of this discussion is exactly, is to exactly understand or discuss what's the best elements in the in our application that can that we can capture a in different formats and add to each of these sections. So we want to fill up lots of content here and in different formats. So the formats that are available are GIF. We can draw it out, to write it out. So the format that are available for us are, there is GIF or plain old PNGs, and then, and then these GIFs can be as short as, say, five seconds, and they can be as long as 20 seconds to in fact, they can go beyond and they can also be up to one minute. I don't know what's the consequence of creating the GIF. Gifs have the disadvantage of they won't allow the user to scroll forward or backwards. I think it is possible to pause and resume. I've seen that on GitHub and restart, but users cannot drag wildly different so that is why usually these are not long. And then another element is obviously videos. So videos are of various types, like illustration videos hand drawn, whiteboard drawings or recordings, whiteboards, recording or iPad, iPad or hand whiteboard is more or less the same. It's a different tool. That's all there is pen, there is surface to write, whether it is iPad or whiteboard. But if it is whiteboard, most likely human face is going to probably it's hard to remove it, I guess. Or maybe it's still possible. Maybe we can stand some far off and we can have the camera here and draw that that is also an option, or iPad with the pen on it and the camera from top down. So those are ways to do it, and screen recordings and or a combination of both iPad explanations and screen recording, these require editing and nirshad might be able to help us to edit, but so the stock steps so for PNGs and jits, PNGs don't need any preparation. We just have to decide which what should again, PNGs are also of same type, either it is hand sketch showing some architecture diagram or something, or it can also be a screenshot from the app, from either from the app or from figma, If you need any customizations and GIF also require like, some type of screen recording and then convert it into GIFs. We can do hand sketches with GIFs. Oh, well, hand sketches with GIFs are also possible. I tested it out, which is, we can do a screen record of this thing iPad where we draw, or, like, do some type of animation and record it and convert it into a GIF. This is also good hack. You can do colors, icons and all of that on the iPad, so we have that. And then we say, we simply, like, draw a connection, and then connection back. And if you record it, it becomes a nice GIF, unless, unlike a static image where we have like, two points, A and B, if you want to show an interaction, yeah, just hands drawn sketch will help. Or we can say, put a and b first, and then start recording the iPad, and then do something like this, and then something like this, so it becomes more interactive. That's that's like a lightweight way to create GIFs, but engaging. So coming to videos, the workflow for videos is obviously record, edit and publish. However, for all these three, all of these are regardless of the format, the important part is, what do we want to convey? What is, what is the message that we are trying to get, get across to the visitors, and because we don't want to record long videos. That is where these section titles come in, right? So they obviously, they're already very narrowly scoped that which is helpful. Up until now, all of the initiatives to create the content have failed because of that broader scope. Yeah. Also, are we not

Suresh Attaluri  9:03  
thinking of text to explain this, create this content is also a form of content, right? So, script,

Swarup Donepudi  9:13  
yeah, that is preparation. What is it like a trans so that begins with the question, which is,

Suresh Attaluri  9:21  
I'm not talking about script. I'm saying in a web page, we can convey that message

Swarup Donepudi  9:27  
that is text, video, image or text is already there. That's the point, right? Like, this is what we have come up with already, okay? But that is why I said refining that is a version two goal right now we want to, like, go through full iteration first, or even when we are discussing, if you identify that. Well, this section can be properly rephrased here. We can accommodate those, but coming up with those titles and all was already a lot of preparation, same kind of discussions. But the goal ultimately, we knew that these, this messaging and positioning, will have to iterate. We go one full round, etc, etc.

Suresh Attaluri  10:19  
But yeah, that is so my point was, I don't know what others are doing in other websites, the content is more of text or more of a video things.

Swarup Donepudi  10:29  
So as I said, I kind of set the bar high when it came to website, because I feel like this is an opportunity for us to stand out from the crowd too, because I felt like we have put in so much hard work into the app, and when it comes to selling, if we don't like for example, whenever we built any feature, we went to great lengths to kind of make sure we do the best possible work on those features, right? I think this area is where that creativity has to be at a game. So I am where, what is it that other people are doing versus like? Should we simply, like, follow their cue? I'm like, we have an opportunity. I think what others are doing is very much like, the hero sections will have one video explaining stuff, and all sections will have some kind of mostly text and title with some kind of random animation, but it didn't feel like they have put in so much care into each section. But because we are in the process of creating that website, obviously those founders were also in the same shoes as we are in right now when they were creating website, right it is a lot of work. So they might have been like, okay, let's, let's get, get past this. And in a way, we are also trying to do that so but so far, we have done so much research to make it possible for us to create these meaning. What I am saying is we have arranged tooling, we have gotten all the cameras, we kind of figured out what software to use. So all of that hard work has been done for a very long time. But where are we stuck is, what do we want to show if this can be figured out? Then we have we are totally capable of doing something that most others are not doing, which is provide much more easier explanations for the visitors, so that they truly understand why something was built. Okay, so that is the whole point of this agenda, why we are meeting. So we kind of, I'll first explain the structure of the page, what went into structuring the content like that, and we'll see on GitHub what, what is the section title and what is the text, so that without the UI part, you will be able to understand whether or not the text in isolation? Is it like actually conveying what, what it is supposed to convey? And then we'll move on to the visual elements, which irshad has already put together on figma. And finally, on figma. While we are on figma, we'll figure out what can be added there an image, a GIF, or a video. If, if we decide on these, we think about like, what? What part of the app should we record? Like, maybe like, do we want to create a Redis Database to demonstrate this particular capability? Or do we have to issue or grant some access to some resource to demonstrate this capability to the visitor in a better way. So these are the conversations that we are going to have, and obviously we are taking recording all of this, so we are going to use this transcription and feed it into chat GPT, and get get a step by step process from chatgpt. And maybe I can also ask chatgpt based on, hey, here is what we thought. So what do you think? If it's like, yeah, you can create this chief, and I'm explicitly calling out all of these tools. And the way we can do these things is to let chatgpt know that, hey, these are the tools we have, and these are like thoughts we came up with, etc, okay, yes, with that. Okay, yeah. Here is the landing page, landing main page, so every page will have what is called Hero section. Hero section is popular in like a web dev space, where that is the first thing that user kind of sees as soon as he lands page. So on landing page, we are saying conversational DevOps is the future. The future is here. I think this has been like review players, and it looks solid to me from a missing messaging positioning standpoint. And I asked you, shark, if it's possible to be like, can we show the conversational DevOps is the future as soon as that's already there, when the user is on the page, okay, he opens the page and he sees conversational DevOps, is it? And, like, maybe a split second later, the future is here will slowly show up, or some kind of electric effect or something. So that's what I asked. Yeah, you can we can do that during development, kind of cinematic effect, I guess. And I'm going to share this video recording with both Satish and Isha and even maybe Pawan, so that they understand what, what's the behind the scenes work that has been gone or that has been put in to come up with these like media content. Okay, so, and then the sub headline is transforming DevOps workflows through a conversations again. And at any point, if you want to stop and add your inputs, let me know, or else I'll keep going. And right now for here, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  16:39  
what can we just see how database the reason I'm saying is we're claiming that conventional conversational DevOps is the future and future is here. So when we pitch this website to users, are we missing something? I mean, are we not telling what is the problem that we are solving here? Or, since, I mean,

Swarup Donepudi  17:13  
every you don't have to put any disclaimers here saying this is no like you don't have to say it's just my feeling or anything. And the whole point of this conversation is to get your input out. So whatever you feel like, everything is valid point. So, so, yeah, this is so build and ship your software on single collaborator platform, is what GitHub has. Yeah? So,

Suresh Attaluri  17:39  
so that's the actual problem that these guys are solving. And co pilot or AI is a additional solution that convenience that they are giving through their product, right? Yeah, so same here in our case. Yes, we. We want that conversational thing to be highlighted, okay? But again, at the same point, I feel that it is more appealing to an investor than a customer when he wants to try this, try product. I don't know the actual intention is not to try conversational, AI, right? The actual intention for

Swarup Donepudi  18:28  
the reason for so that is what is all about, positioning, meaning, how do you want your customers to see? You see? Okay, so what are we is one, one way to think about it, right? I think there are at least 50 other companies who will have the same exact answer as we do. So that's, that's like we are saying the truth. You have 50 options. Now maybe it's, it's your pick, and then I so that is where right we are. We have been constantly iterating. And even for customers. Obviously, a is not the only word there. It's about conversational DevOps. DevOps is a thing

Suresh Attaluri  19:14  
I'm looking at value like the customers journey standpoint, like if I am a customer of plant and cloud, I won't start my journey looking for a conversational AI platform where I can conversational DevOps, a platform that would be my

Swarup Donepudi  19:34  
again, I think also, like, it's not, it's most likely not going To be like, again, this is something that I learned from both books and my own journey so far, which is, it is not going to happen that without us actually sending the link to somebody with us knowing their background and letting them know that we have built some solution. So there's already some context when somebody is already looking at this page, meaning we are solving so and so there is going to be a precon. It's not going to be like somebody is going for a solution and they land upon this solution, and they are going to sign up and subscribe. I think we are very far away from that. So at this point it's going to be like, who is whoever is going like, for example, we are going to post it on show Hacker News, right? We are going to tell them that, hey, we built so and so to solve so and so. Here is our prop website. Can you go and check it out? Okay? So that that is how you bring people in, which is you explain something to people, and they, if they are interested, they'll come check it out. So this GitHub is different. Again, we cannot direct, do a direct comparison, because they are well established platform, and it is, I don't even know if people come here and see this and actually buy it, because GitHub is that big right now, they just put it, I guess, put something there. I wonder what was, what is it that they put on like their first launch?

Suresh Attaluri  21:18  
So how I'm looking at that hero section is. Hero section is the first thing that we want anyone to know about, plant and cloud.

Swarup Donepudi  21:29  
No, I want. I mean, not I want. Hero section is not the place where people learn about the product itself. Hero section is the place where they find the most special thing about that, thing that it is solved. So we the our previous version is internal developer platform, right? And everything is generic term. There is nothing catchy, nothing. And this is a sales website, right So, and even here, join the world's most widely adopted, AI powered developer platform. This can have any number of meanings today. Developer platforms can have any number of and internal developer platform, I think, because of the number of competitors or solutions that have come up already. And also, there is a risk to that word itself, because the word itself is like relatively new to the market. DevOps has been there for a very long time. So that is very universal. DevOps is very universal. And that, that was one of the reason why we chose that word, A is also universal today. Whereas you put platform engineering or internal developer platform, even within the community, people are trying to learn what the word is like. For example, if I tell deep, who has been in like DevOps for a while, she would be like, what is an internal platform, so that that's like a huge risk right now. So if we want some kind of attention, we don't want to use those technical terms that truly reflect the product today, right? And for me, that it's, it's now it's not going, definitely not going to be like you. People will start searching for it. These will be like sales led conversations, meaning outreach. We go we put it on Hacker News, we put it on platform, engineering, Slack channel, and we say, this is what we do, and then we lead people into it. So now, when they come in, what is that we want to, like, surprise them with, or get their attention immediately. By the time they come here, they all we know, because somebody told them that, hey, here is something that we built to solve some problem. Can you, like, try it out,

Suresh Attaluri  24:06  
and conversational DevOps is the future. Yeah?

Conversations so I see DevOps, again, a generic word, but here we are showing in the GIF, I think we need to show what is that we are doing, right, like the request here in the plan chart is I need a Eks cluster, create a new Eks cluster. But the GIF is not completed, I think so we can add something where it is being deployed, and also, I'm sure that it is already deployed in the AWS

Swarup Donepudi  25:03  
Okay, side of Yeah, I think I asked even in chef, he basically took it from whatever was on figma already. I told him to give better conversation. Yeah, glad on the video behind the hero section, yeah, that tells a lot about the story. Yeah. And what should that be? These are the tough questions, actually. So now getting if Yeah, it is totally true that if the conversation can be more relevant and can convey a more bigger story in a short time. That's awesome. That's great. The tough part is, and the important part right now is to go for one step further and discuss and finalize what those should be concretely. And what do you think?

Suresh Attaluri  26:03  
Same thing. I need new eks. I need to create new Eks cluster. Okay, that is a starting point. Yeah. And then, like in right now, the implemented version of plant and plant over will give a prompt saying, I will need these certain inputs to create AK,

Swarup Donepudi  26:23  
all of that here in this background. Okay, I don't know if the about the technical implementations these, these are very large files. Okay, for some reason, without 4k rendering, he was able to, like, squeeze it into like, 15 MB or something

Suresh Attaluri  26:44  
like that. So let's keep the prompt. User will ask, I need a Eks cluster, and that will trigger a Stackdriver will show the

Swarup Donepudi  26:54  
Okay, we'll try it out. I don't know. Again, limitations of what can Sameer put there within those technical exercise limitations. So the story that we want to say is even, yeah, stack job again. I think we you and I have been so close to this product. We think multi cloud deployments is the only thing in the product so far, and I think we are still stuck there. The very first thing that comes to mind is, again, deploy something and then stack job. I'm just critical questioning here. I'm pushing beyond which is, is that DevOps? Is that, will that truly represent,

Unknown Speaker  27:39  
yeah, the DevOps perspective.

Swarup Donepudi  27:42  
So this is from insider perspective, right? That is what we feel like showing, because we feel like that's the that's like 80% of time we spent, and that's like 80% of the core of the product. So we want to show that, but that doesn't mean that is DevOps, right? So that is where I'm questioning, like I won't deploy something, and then showing a pulumi stack within the chat, okay? It seems like divorce, again, just critical question, yes or no, yeah, even I am on the same page as you, because we both are, like, so close to the product, right? I can't even, I can't think of anything, anything. So maybe we'll try with Samir,

Suresh Attaluri  28:30  
or forget about stack job blocks. We can just show that AKs cluster a message is sent to plant, or they create an Eks cluster. Next response that you get is, Eks cluster has been created, yeah, if possible, we can. We can. Another view is the AWS side of it being created.

Swarup Donepudi  28:58  
Yeah, I think that all of that is not necessary. This is what I kind of got stuck in for a very long time, which is you want to tell as big of a story as possible all the time, like the complete stories, but understand that there is more, right? So we have more. So in that case, it is not necessary that it the story need to be told here and the user is going to show the page.

Suresh Attaluri  29:22  
One thing we can do is conversational DevOps. If you ask something,

Swarup Donepudi  29:28  
yeah, that, I think that that so far that these two things align, except that there is no response. There is no

Suresh Attaluri  29:35  
response, yeah, that's, that's one. Oh, there is actually so I can, it says that I can assist you, but, but that is

Swarup Donepudi  29:44  
that is also good to me, to me that is better meaning it is having a conversation versus saying I want a headache. It Right.

Suresh Attaluri  29:57  
In that case, how about we ask the we show that prompt as well. Like, if you need to create an Eks cluster, give me

Swarup Donepudi  30:05  
these Yeah, because you can expand on that, and you add more quality to the response. Saying yeah, if I can get so instead of saying a basic one, we can say yeah. You can give me the VPC or some advanced input, rather than like basic question and answer to let people know that this is an advanced bot. It's not like

Suresh Attaluri  30:26  
a very it has that all intelligence to pass on to the provider, collect the information, pass on to the provider. Yeah, so I mean, it will have that sense of guided journey to the customer to user as well. Yeah, you don't need to worry about what has to be provided. So

Swarup Donepudi  30:52  
four message team, yeah, we can also probably, like, remove some of these are, like, nice graphics, I know

Suresh Attaluri  31:01  
the canvas thing can be removed, yeah, and only planned on,

Swarup Donepudi  31:08  
yeah. I think that's better experience. Definitely. This adds more elegance to the quality of the website. Obviously, it is not useful for conveying some message there. Presentation wise, it has, like, some type of effect. But yeah, we can, we can try things out overall, the to the to conclude the hero section, we want also, do you want to add a button to say, Watch video right here. Or as the user scrolls to the next section, we can here, we can add a video thumbnail. So again, going back to the Okay, yeah, maybe I should do that. I'm opening github.com once again. So as you scroll next, right? This is where they were. They already did GIF,

Unknown Speaker  32:05  
yeah, if you see here,

Swarup Donepudi  32:08  
yeah. So that's why, that's why I'm telling the hero section doesn't have to tell the full story, full story. We are breaking down the stories, and we are providing the access to those stories, making them accessible where, in like, right after the hero section. It's not like he has to spend another five minutes and navigate and so, yeah, we can tell more stories outside the hero section to you. In fact, if you see GitHub, you know they don't have anything he

Suresh Attaluri  32:39  
was so the gift thing, they don't have it again.

Swarup Donepudi  32:45  
Every designer has their own touch. So we didn't ask for it if showed it to us, and it's, it's kind of fancy and nice, better than GitHub, I feel like, or at least like, given that we are a startup, we want to, like, create a first impression saying, Oh, these guys, people judge us because we are India Indians. There is also that meaning we represent low quality engineering, but we are, like, going back all band with, like, some flashy animation. So I want to keep that part, but improve the conversation with probably more relevant response. But yeah, if you see GitHub, even this was my idea, as the user scrolls to the top, we we now, even if you see here, this is a GIF. You can play, but you can't. You can play or pause, but you cannot do forward or remind. And it has these and these. I think this is also part of the same thing that it shared, the written, the hero element. All of this is probably Adobe effects. This

Suresh Attaluri  33:52  
looks more real or more Yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  33:57  
yeah. This can be, which can be our full screen screen recording, yeah, and then the chat begins here, and then it can be expanded

Unknown Speaker  34:06  
that has that feeling of more animated, yeah? That's

Swarup Donepudi  34:10  
not for showing the entire conversations. That is more for, like showing animated, fancy stuff, yeah? And even, even there, right? There is some definitely conversational DevOps, and there is a chat bot, and somebody is writing something, and bot is responding back. So conversational DevOps and something related to DevOps. So I think all of that actually fits good. We can make we

Suresh Attaluri  34:39  
remove the canvas. Okay, we'll have a chart. We still have the chart user will be typing instead of two messages that there's one message from user, one message from client, or make it a four message

Swarup Donepudi  34:51  
thing, okay,

Suresh Attaluri  34:56  
and we'll end it there for the animated one. Okay, so since the only reason that is we are not talking about Canvas here, and without giving the canvas context, also, I don't know how relevant is Canvas on this I a hero section, yeah, I think

Swarup Donepudi  35:29  
even I don't know, and just thinking, how would it look with just chat box, meaning the overall animation? We have to see how, what Sameer can come up with. Like, if you see, he grew us into that chat conversation with some kind of animation. I relate that to other like movie trailers or like Game of Thrones. They show the important part, but they move the camera over something where I'm not really paying attention to the detail, but the animated effect is taking me somewhere and like the creating that build up, yeah, exactly, yeah. So creating that build up and then showing me that thing versus June, here is the most important thing. That is what I thought Samir was trying to accomplish. I think this is actually a standard effect that he didn't, he most likely didn't come with the whole concept of this build up, and I'm showing this. It's probably an Adobe After Effects thing where people do these kind of patterns, but will itself. Is going to watch this. So he will probably get a get what we feel and and see even we didn't even ask for this.

Suresh Attaluri  36:40  
Do you remember that those gifs we used to get in Excel with the old Excel Help Text, they used to be these icons coming up on our Excel or Word document, okay? And when we click on them, that's when they used to open a chart and we used to enter us. Okay? So, okay, I think let's leave the creative part to do this. My idea, or my thought was, we'll have some small plantora thing jumping up here. Okay, have an effect of clicking it, and it will get open and then all that chat happening,

Swarup Donepudi  37:21  
yeah, for me again, from the standpoint of making progress, there is so many decisions we need to make, so and we are going to have V twos and V threes. And important goal for us right now is to fill up most of these voids and roll it out because see, okay, what's our next important journey is have those conversations, right whether or not we have the greatest animation or not the greatest animation, what is going to block the conversations is actually the readiness of the website, not the awesome, awesome, like the most awesome website, which is ready, yeah, but there is a middle ground. Meaning, why did we do one page with like, one hero section and one login and, well, we don't want to do that. So I think this is already, like, ultra step improvement from what we then we task for it, right? We only wanted this. All of this is the shots creation, or something is creation. So we are now. We are greedy people, obviously. So we want, like, more from what's already there. So what I propose is, like, we let that creativity part to them, and we'll let them know that, hey, we want to highlight the conversation, DevOps conversation, DevOps part, and we want to give a better conversation. Yeah, better conversation. It's not like a Hello World thing. We want to show something advanced to let people assume that it's an advanced bot. It's not like a Hello World bot because a lot of people are also talking about it. And based on our experience, we learned that doing the Hello World is easy, but doing something advanced is tough, and I think we are overthinking that can also be possible, okay, so as the use of

Suresh Attaluri  39:28  
scroll. So one, one change that we decide of Hero, Hero section is this animation?

Swarup Donepudi  39:33  
Yeah, only animation, not animation. We are not expecting experts in animation. What is that we want to convey? Is what we decided we let the animation modifications to which happens somewhere, and what is the modification that we want here is a better conversation, okay? And I think it's a long conversation already, so we'll revisit this page tomorrow, where I mean, you can you, and I can think about it, and probably finally, come with those three or four conversation exchanges, and we need to update the requirements doc for initial and Bucha is going to do that, okay, so that's still to do for us, okay? And so this part is all like, neat, no changes, just the conversation part. And as the user scrolls, yeah. So this is where we are actually showing what we want the users to know. So this, this is actually called as, what I called it as, as problem definition section, okay, so the hero section is for, like, the boom, like something that you don't hear elsewhere. And okay, now let me without wasting a lot of time, let me explain what is that we built and we are trying to solve. And that is where the problem definition comes in, and it says setting the gold standard for internal developer platforms in fast paced world of software development, etc. Before that,

Suresh Attaluri  41:00  
how about we add a video or any form of content,

Swarup Donepudi  41:04  
Yeah, same thing, right? Same thing as GitHub, right? For like

Suresh Attaluri  41:07  
this one this, they have created this GIF, but we can add video also right at the hero section itself, we can add a video link or a small video thumbnail

Swarup Donepudi  41:22  
that I mean? Why? Why not this

Unknown Speaker  41:26  
below section? Okay,

Swarup Donepudi  41:28  
so, so there is already an introduction here.

Suresh Attaluri  41:31  
The reason for this is this GIF looks complicated, and then talking with you,

Swarup Donepudi  41:36  
no in place of GIF will have video. Video, yeah, yeah. Same exact thing, easy, same exact play button, yeah. But it's going to be a video with audio, with, like, the full fledged story that we want to tell.

Suresh Attaluri  41:52  
Like, we can, we can show them. I mean, we can create and show,

Swarup Donepudi  41:56  
I think, triple dot, triple screen sharing. Tuple, the best remote page. Tuple, dot app. Tuple, dot app. You see come here. So, okay, actually, these guys probably have modified it. So two years ago, when we started, okay, this page had the creator of the founder, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  42:22  
a small video, right, yeah. But if you see here, this looks like a screen recording, only you can have similar thing, right, like, Yeah, this is GIF.

Swarup Donepudi  42:33  
Oh, is it, yeah? This is it will keep repeating itself. You see, same thing came. They modify, but screen record. No screen recordings can be converted to chips, right? But this is not a video of what I'm saying, because you don't hear audio. There

Suresh Attaluri  42:48  
are two types of chips, one which is created, which is right now,

Swarup Donepudi  42:54  
that is not even if that is video that also has already audio, it's so okay. That's being played in the browser, there is a sound icon also,

Suresh Attaluri  43:01  
okay, so, but the way it is created itself, yeah, they use some tag, I mean, which requires attention towards what

Swarup Donepudi  43:13  
you're saying. So ask this. We won't ask if

Suresh Attaluri  43:17  
shad we it's not required to be a high quality videos, simple screen recording.

Swarup Donepudi  43:24  
That is, that is why I have this GIF Fox ready. Okay, so, so that is, I shared a few gifs in the past, also, right. So,

Unknown Speaker  43:31  
let's use that.

Swarup Donepudi  43:33  
That's why I mentioned when we say, here we can, we can create these GIFs with screen recordings also, okay. In fact, that is the only thing we can do. Or I told you that the gib can also be created with iPad recording, where we want to explain some connections between some things. And it can also be both, by the way, okay. And

Suresh Attaluri  43:55  
I see this pattern that they're not fully exposing this section on the hero, on the hero, yeah?

Swarup Donepudi  44:01  
But then as you scroll up now, you see that part, yeah, we'll let it shall know about that. Even this one is same story. And when it comes to ours, yeah, the first part is not showing what is next, yeah, like in I think that's something for inshallah and and we'll make sure this part directly shows videos. And I like the way GitHub has multiple of these actually. So you say this part, right? Yeah. So here it says, build code quickly and more securely this thing, and that is what they are explaining here. And you switch this, it changes so in plan, so we can come up with sections here. These

Suresh Attaluri  44:47  
are the actual products screens

Swarup Donepudi  44:52  
we can this is what I told you. Said that this is what I want as the second part. Yeah, because, as I said, we want this. We want to throw as much useful content as possible for users to understand the capabilities of the product or

Suresh Attaluri  45:08  
the hero section itself. Everything is, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  45:11  
yeah. So we are leveraging the hero section to, like, tell the biggest asset we have, right, even from a customer standpoint, right? A DevOps, to me, is a customer thing, not just investor thing. Reason is my own experience of like all of one, I keep exploring products to solve various problems, right? Customer, I'm not an investor in anything, but I'm looking for a solutions. If there is no AI, meaning I have to do more work. And I'm like, Why don't they leverage AI and solve this problem in any way? So that is why we were, like, telling that story, and the animation part is to, like, tell the world that we are not like poor quality roadside guys like, create a good global brand, okay, and immediately bring them to the videos part, which is, now, let's educate them. Okay, so here, okay, so getting close to one hour will continue tomorrow, but tomorrow you will begin with, what kind of what are these alternatives in our own case, like code, plan, collaborate, automate and secure, if you, if you see that tells GitHub story, yeah, GitHub code

Suresh Attaluri  46:44  
one thing that I'm noticing here is they don't have co pilot. The co pilot thing came up recently, right? Yeah, but they are highlighting that only the code is code part is their actual product in a plan, collaborate, automated, secure or not, are not or are not the primary features. They had code, but there's showing code. They're showing the cooperating,

Swarup Donepudi  47:14  
I think, yeah, repositioning, right? You will always have so constantly iterate in your My

Suresh Attaluri  47:18  
first question when I asked why to highlight conversational AI, I think we are also doing Yeah, same thing,

Swarup Donepudi  47:27  
yeah. That's what people will learn about what we do within like first maybe three, four seconds or like, as they scroll to the next part. And as I said, no one is going to visit our website without them being brought there with some initial context. And people will only go there if they like the context, and if they if they have a problem in that area, in that space. Okay, so, yeah, tomorrow, it's a 48 minute recording already tomorrow we are going to start with, how do we want to construct this? I don't know what to call this. GitHub writes it as coaches, plan, collaborate, automate, secure. No, it's actually it feels like a sentence, read it, read it in sequence. Okay? Code, plan, collaborate, automate, secure, like it's like a sentence works, put in sequence, right? So we can come up with something similar. What you can do with plant and Pro Plan number, I think that's, yeah, exactly the aim of the that is the theme here, right? What can you do with GitHub is you can code, plan, collaborate, automate and secure, cool. I think in our case also, we can definitely do yes, yeah. I see collaborate, yeah, Bootstrap, build, deploy, yeah, and then operate. Day to Ops is a big thing. And in fact, day two Ops is actually a pretty big thing. We kind of built Kubernetes features and then eventually called it day two ops, right? But I've seen Day Two plus operations as a big deal in a lot of conversations. So I think we can do something like that on that. Maybe audit we'll see. So we'll continue tomorrow. I think this is good conversation. I finally feel like we can make progress, because I'm getting action items from each of these, like, if I know what to record, what GIFs to create, what should be the story within that gif, I have the tools I can clearly capture them and finalize them quickly. So sure, cool. Thank you, Suresh, thank you so much for your time. Yeah. Thank you Swarup. First long procedure.
