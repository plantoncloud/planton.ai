Swarup Donepudi  0:09  
Okay, so first, let's go over the section where we highlight Kubernetes dashboard on the landing page. So the structure of this landing page itself is, you have the hero section and then followed by problem statement section, saying, This is what we do with the title. And this was primarily introduced to clearly say that we are we fall under internal development platform, because DevOps can mean many things, many platforms, and we want to highlight that this is an internal platform. So,

Suresh Attaluri  0:59  
so yeah, so is it considered as a feature?

Swarup Donepudi  1:02  
No, okay, yeah, this is something that we shall be eventually fix, but going back to this, so here, I told him that this is a problem definitions, okay, but he thought that it is feature. So what? There is not be anything here. Okay, so also, yeah, if

Suresh Attaluri  1:24  
we are defining a problem, definition here, internal developer platform is not not a problem, right? It is a solution.

Swarup Donepudi  1:35  
So what I mean by problem definition or statement definition is probably the problem with the title, but my intention was to say when, when we say, what is plant control? I would simply say it is an internal developer platform with your conversational capabilities, okay? So to establish the category and the product, what the product can be called as. That is why we added this section, but I put the title of the section as problem definition section.

Suresh Attaluri  2:13  
Okay, so if, if, if we are talking about problem definition, not solving DevOps bottlenecks or something,

Swarup Donepudi  2:23  
right? Yeah, so that that went into the first one on this, and then I think this one is breakthrough from DevOps bottleneck, etc. So, in a way, in a way, none of these titles were actually like carefully crafted. It's more like record talk and let chatgputi Give it a lot of context on like, Hey, we are for self service. Blah, blah, blah. Can you come up with a hero section, a few subsections based on the conversation? And finally, a Call to Action section. So we asked it to generate three hero sections so that we can, like, we can choose the best one that we feel might be relevant. So that is the iteration that we went through. So even in case of here, when we are doing the landing page, okay, the hero section is done, and we are saying, claiming a capabilities, but the actual platform itself is we have built an internal developer platform for so and so. Even though it says setting the gold standard for internal developer platforms, the title that chatgpt actually gave was kind of slightly different, it kind of summarized this, but I wanted to call it out that, like we are, well, we are solving software bottlenecks in software development in general. But the title I want to do something different with that by saying many people are building internal development platforms. And we are setting a gold standard, yeah, but this, this actually explains the problem. This is not

Suresh Attaluri  4:11  
a feature, okay, yeah, that's not a feature, but it tells about the product.

Swarup Donepudi  4:18  
Yeah, that's what it is product definition rather than problem definition, yeah, product definition, yeah. What is this product and, and I feel like this is my own belief, also, which is a lot of people are trying to build internet developer platforms. Yeah, right. For me, nothing stands out so far, we have the opportunity to, like, build something really good that people will find lot of strengths in the product. To say, hey, JIRA is what comes to my mind when we are thinking about project management. Similarly, Gmail comes to my mind because talking about opening open email. So quantum cloud zero comes to mind when I think about adding same login or sign up. Planta cloud comes to my mind when I'm thinking about internet. So that is the ultimate goal.

Suresh Attaluri  5:17  
And what is unified internal developer platform? We used that word unified, yeah, what does that even?

Swarup Donepudi  5:28  
I don't know. I think I replaced some word with internal platform, okay, okay, unified in plant on Cloud introduces a revolutionary approach, right? Integrating AI powered, conversational. Into a unified development platform. Again, I didn't, yeah, vocabulary like chatgpt, we didn't craft that's why I said we didn't craft those titles. Only made some modifications. I don't even if I did this. I don't think I did it, but,

Suresh Attaluri  6:03  
and next thing is, so that is a text that we get below. Yeah, this

Swarup Donepudi  6:10  
image. So these all images on the site that you see are samples taken by HR. Dump them, and he is, his expectation is, we will give him this. And that is the purpose of these conversations. So, yeah, this part that's for us to kind of so

Suresh Attaluri  6:30  
what I'm thinking is like, if we are saying this section is to say, what is our product all about? Yeah. So,

Swarup Donepudi  6:39  
so I felt like this. This one actually should have had this one, which is,

it is because her room is messing with

Suresh Attaluri  7:02  
I think dashboard is a nice place.

Swarup Donepudi  7:06  
Dashboard is not a nice place. I believe dashboard has nothing

Suresh Attaluri  7:13  
or canvas like showing all the resources. This might be a good element to go there.

Swarup Donepudi  7:22  
So it's not possible for us to show that we are internal developer platform. Okay by our dashboard, okay? Because when you see this, do you see an internal platform like obviously, we lived with these products for so long, I think we might. But bring some external person and

Suresh Attaluri  7:47  
how about, okay, we'll show, I thought this

Swarup Donepudi  7:49  
something like this. Okay, so you have plant uncloud in between.

Suresh Attaluri  7:54  
You're not showing the product, yeah.

Swarup Donepudi  7:57  
So on one side you have discovery. On one side, you have Iam provisioning. On one side you have, like, the same story elements we wrote. You can provision, you can bootstrap, you can discover. You can set up, build and automation.

Suresh Attaluri  8:11  
We can add the design document, kind of something which we are doing on iPad, right? Like where Planning Cloud stands, where service

Swarup Donepudi  8:21  
itself can also design. This is when I saw this. I felt like, if I give him more icons and more text, he could definitely build something like this, because he did this. So that is what I feel like I should be on, because that is what we commonly see on other apps

Suresh Attaluri  8:39  
there. So how will we give it to his, sir? What is the form and

Swarup Donepudi  8:43  
share? So we have to give him a hand drawn sketch or a discussion, saying between and he needs concrete elements. Like, for example, when he drew this, he kind of came up with this, because when I gave him the this text for multi cloud page. I also asked chat GPT on, give, give some visual element help for my UX designer. So that included saying, put random code in between, in the middle, and put surrounded, because this is a multi cloud adoption page surrounded with some different cloud provider icons. So it gave that visual. Decided, similarly, we need to give him the concrete visual help, saying, Put plantain cloud in between and surround it with these elements. Can let service discuss those elements. So that is so when, in our current effort that we are doing, by the end of this discussion, we need to have this kind of nail down. That is one. So, yeah, we should. So the we can draw it out. Yeah,

it okay. So, can you take

a picture of that? I

Okay, so we are basically discussing,

is that okay, yeah, so we want to say it's an internal developer platform,

Suresh Attaluri  11:10  
yes,

Swarup Donepudi  11:13  
and because there is no single screenshot on our app that shows what is an internal developer platform? Now we need to come up with some ideas. And for that, I kind of showed you an inspiration based on what it should do, where we have p in the middle, Platinum code logo surrounded by what it does. So this is one way to do it, and another way to show it is your plan. Term in between where there is platform engineers and where there is devs like clearly solving what is meant to solve. Platform engineers will write IAC, write and publish IAC devs consume that IAC, and then maybe architects will write and publish templates. Devs consume those templates to boots have new services, so something like that, like and devs also kind of discover other services, discover Other services. Devs can do monitoring or operate, observe, operate, iterate, operate, observe something like that. So this is one way to look at it, like the parties that it is aimed to benefit by an internal developer platform solution.

Suresh Attaluri  12:54  
Yeah, I think this. This is, this tells more about internal developer platform, yeah, one which we have on the website, yeah. It says that one is more of multi cloud, multi cloud, multi cloud, and this one is more of how internet developer platform is used by other

Swarup Donepudi  13:14  
okay. Yeah. So this can be they

Suresh Attaluri  13:18  
can deploy services, they can build servers. Can do, yeah?

Swarup Donepudi  13:21  
So it's surrounded around devs, yeah, I think we can do something like we can ask as a bird also, yeah, we can ask to come up with some type of infographic where there are devs, there are devs as a group on one side, and there are platform engineers on another side, a group of platform name, and there is platinum cloud here, and We can show something like this, where we tell what they can do, what they each phone can do. And here also something like each line tells one story, like new services, configure, set up, CICD, deploy, operate, discover,

Suresh Attaluri  14:25  
monitor. So basically, what internal developer platform does is this thing, right? What happens if London cloud is not there? Let us say, discover, yeah, if landing cloud is not there. This developer will directly reach out, to reach out to this guy, and this platform engineering group has to inform them, if you can also draw those lines, what before and

Swarup Donepudi  14:55  
after? Kind of a thing, before and after, also in other places, like without, and that is also a good option, definitely. So clearly showing in this,

Suresh Attaluri  15:09  
if we have drawing lines till we have been having a solid line and then a dotted line representing that, if this, if Planning Cloud is not there, yeah,

Swarup Donepudi  15:20  
this can also be a GIF, right? Like, for example, this is where like, creativity comes in, yeah, like the we are trying to get into how it should happen, whereas we need to probably just focus on what needs to happen? Let probably give it a try. We tell him the narrative, but what he definitely requires is a clear instruction. So he cannot take a concept and bring visualization. He can take a clear instruction. Can

Suresh Attaluri  15:58  
we do a quick Google search for internal developer platforms, how, what is if there is any presentation of an internal developer platform?

Speaker 1  16:22  
So jump on to the thing this way.

Swarup Donepudi  16:59  
I look at how many, number of people?

I'm just opening the ones that I think had some better infographic I remember

Speaker 1  17:20  
you telling about some blog where someone was explaining about this internal developer platform. I

Swarup Donepudi  17:57  
yeah, here you see without COVID. Dev talks to ops and with Corey. Dev, no, this is a nice representation. Dev talks to COVID and ops talks to Corey, and Corey manages this. Only one DevOps needed with Corey. That's the message that we are trying to show. Yeah, this is one good reference, and this is for landing page first. Oh, we started off the discussion to talk about the Kubernetes dashboard, and we jumped on to the landing page. Keep going for the landing first, finalize the

Speaker 1  18:45  
land, finalize the that section of landing page. Yeah, let's

Suresh Attaluri  18:51  
scope it that way. Do

Swarup Donepudi  19:08  
you see here the COVID folks, government, governance and custom policies. This is what they want to share say on their app, and they put a random meaning with this policies and government tools, and they put some Same, same as us, right? But for others, they will have some video, yeah, so this is directly loom video,

Suresh Attaluri  19:37  
yeah, you can do that also.

Swarup Donepudi  19:40  
For a few they are doing just a screenshot. For few, they are doing like a loom, video embedded, yeah, and the loom gives a GIF. So this is also interactive. Self Service integrations,

Speaker 2  19:58  
environment provisioning. CL, CLI, API,

Speaker 1  20:15  
I think that is good, right before and after. Thing

Swarup Donepudi  20:19  
can we find out? This is another way I thought about,

Suresh Attaluri  20:24  
yeah, but this talks about no integration and multi cloud enabled.

Swarup Donepudi  20:32  
Multi cloud, this is like everything you can do, source control, yeah, you can do infrastructure. You can do monitoring, so they put it in our case,

Suresh Attaluri  20:41  
we can put these things right, like that with before and after difference. Go to

Suresh Attaluri  20:52  
that screenshot.

Suresh Attaluri  20:59  
Before and After thing. Here they are not explaining why. What is the purpose? Right? Like each line, you can say, sir, that dev wants to build a project. They used to go to ops, but now they want to build a project. Then they will. They come to this guy.

Swarup Donepudi  21:19  
So they're saying Dev, stop talk, but we dev talks to ops, but they are not now, talks to Corey. Ops also talks to COVID and Corey takes care of managing this

Suresh Attaluri  21:35  
same way, which which we have all drawn, but there will be two diagrams. Yeah. We are mentioning that. We'll also mention the purpose of the reason why a platform engineer or ops engineer will talk to

Swarup Donepudi  21:50  
we can also do that if needed, if we can, like, for example, what is it that platform doing is like, this is a bad claim that I don't want to do on our own, yeah, which is, oh, you only need one DevOps guy, so meaning I have filing numbers. I'll make sure COVID will never reach my company, right? So we don't want to create that. Instead, we want to enable platform engineers to, like, say you can write TerraForm modules and register them, yeah, so that devs can

Suresh Attaluri  22:24  
consume so what else can platform engineer do?

Swarup Donepudi  22:28  
Platform can create Kubernetes and allow developers to deploy to that Kubernetes. Oh,

Suresh Attaluri  22:34  
is it, yeah. But what is platform engineering doing? If all, if the module is already available. No module is

Swarup Donepudi  22:43  
not already, not already available. Module is available for those people who don't have a platform instead. But our

Suresh Attaluri  22:50  
the first point that we mentioned is platform engineers will write pulumi modules, yeah, and put it on plant and clock, right? That's what is a responsibility of platform engineering in case of a GKE cluster, no, right? No.

Swarup Donepudi  23:04  
So, so GKE cluster requires cloud accounts, right? So say platform engineer wrote a GKE cluster module registered here only for the purposes of other platform engineers to be able to deploy new GK clusters. Let me finish. What is the meaning there is IAC modules are much broader. They are not just for deploying GK clusters. GK clusters within IAC modules have a special meaning. Those are complicated pieces of infrastructure that are not deployed by devs in general. Even though GK classes can be created from the console, they are still making it like self service for other platform engineers to deploy them. But the IAC modules registration is for like we want to enable you to deploy microservices. We want you to enable you to deploy fargate services. We want you to deploy Redis to Kubernetes, right? So we will create all those modules. So

Suresh Attaluri  24:09  
by saying, platform engineers add these pulumi modules for those resources which,

Swarup Donepudi  24:18  
and in fact, they can, in general, the platform units can create environments and share, share allow the devs to start deploying to those environments.

Speaker 1  24:27  
So what do we call this thing?

Swarup Donepudi  24:31  
I'm saying about these things loud so that I can have chatgpt determine those words. So we want to call out those things that way chatgpt goes. That's the whole point. We fail. We suck at coming up with the exact terms,

Suresh Attaluri  24:47  
or for lack of vocabulary or lack of name for that, it is platform engineers deploying complex infrastructure. Setting

Swarup Donepudi  24:57  
up environments. Is the word setting up and yeah, so it's not the complexity is not the determine, but platform engineers are the ones who will kind of set things up for developers to start deploying, like Kafka is a complex, yeah? That that that hasn't fall under this category, right? Yeah. So environments is the word where, when, when you take an organization, the environments have the boundary. Can we

Suresh Attaluri  25:26  
say that, where services can be deployed? Yeah, so environments

Swarup Donepudi  25:34  
control. Like cost associated with environment like credentials are associated with environments.

Suresh Attaluri  25:44  
The other softwares can be run or environment.

Swarup Donepudi  25:48  
We don't have to define it. That's a general for example, our

Suresh Attaluri  25:52  
environment, I don't want

Swarup Donepudi  25:55  
even our environment, is not an abstracted term, is what I'm saying. We tried to align the perceived like definition of environment is what is also considered as an environment in our system. We didn't like create an abstraction like, for example, we can take references of our own companies, right? I came from Zillow, okay. What is an environment is a logical grouping of services. Yes, same thing here again, we didn't create anything. And every environment for it will have a corresponding infrastructure space where the services that are claimed to be deployed into that will land. These are all actually certain set up where DevOps or platform engineers only. So setting up environments has been a very classic problem, and devs don't get involved there. Devs will request for environments so that they can start deploying. So there was a second, yeah, using plant and using plant, yeah, so they can write IAC modules, register them here, or create IAC and register for devs to consume and set up environments. So in our case, what is setting up environments is say they create transverse prod, and say

Suresh Attaluri  27:17  
transverse prod is the environment,

Swarup Donepudi  27:20  
name of the environment, and they configure the Kubernetes credentials so that all services, when developers choose they go and land on a particular Kubernetes cluster, or they'll configure an AWS connection so that any AWS resources that get deployed to that environment will land in a particular AWS account. Yes, and what else can platform engineers do in our case?

Speaker 1  27:48  
Yeah, but they can, that's fine. What

Swarup Donepudi  27:52  
depths can do? They can bootstrap using platform,

Suresh Attaluri  27:56  
okay, but bootstrap would require templates. Templates.

Swarup Donepudi  27:59  
Templates are either readily available or senior engineers can register templates. Yeah, so that is

Suresh Attaluri  28:06  
that also falls in a devs, dev team of devs. So yeah, they will create, and

Swarup Donepudi  28:13  
if at all we want to highlight who creates those templates and want to highlight that, then we create a separate group called the architects of senior engineers. Senior engineers register service templates with all the best practices built in, and devs will create those new services using those templates.

Suresh Attaluri  28:35  
So bootstrap doesn't involve creating actions,

Swarup Donepudi  28:43  
right second of CAC or confidence services and planting road can help. Yeah, those are two different and platform engineers are the one who will create those actions and register. Yeah, these

Suresh Attaluri  28:57  
guys will,

Swarup Donepudi  29:00  
the more I've been thinking about quantum cloud and when we say we are setting the golden standard for internal developer platforms, I started believing that for an internal developer platform to be useful for majority, like a vast number of organizations, customizability should be at the heart with minimal abstractions. Yes. Okay, so IAC modules, zero restrictions enforced. You can accept the APA API is something that we had to create because we need to capture the input from the devs. Hand it off to platform in place. But when it comes to the actual modules itself, you can customize it to your heart's content and register them, and they will be self serviced. And GitHub actions and GitHub workflows, we don't do anything like you can write any kind of GitHub action, register it with the code, source code, template library on plankton cloud, and devs can choose which one which action they want to add to their service. Same thing with service templates for everything we are providing defaults and for everything we are enabling or allowing the organizations to customize these workflows, right? So that is also what we want to depict in here, and we should not get greedy, because this will never come out. If we start getting greedy, this will never come out. We need to settle on something. Okay, this work like, for example, a good start can be as simple as this one. All of what, all of our conversation, is being fed into chatgpt, and it is going, I'm going to have a conversation after this, taking the transcription and requesting for Hey, we want an infographic to show all of the platform's capabilities, but should not be too difficult. And my UX designer is skilled at figma, so can you give him some visual element with very detailed steps like something at the center, engineers at the Left Platform, right senior low level. And these are the connections that each one will give it can it is capable of doing that, and yisha will take that and bring us some kind of prototype we can interact from there. Okay, so, yeah,

Suresh Attaluri  31:27  
in case of like columi modules, yeah, managing pulumi modules or TerraForm modules with plant and cloud, if they register, it is easy to search for devs. It will be. But the journey without private cloud would be a GitHub account or some other place where they need to rely on the keyword search.

Swarup Donepudi  31:55  
Or, again, this diagram doesn't have to represent all of that, because we cannot tell the entire story here. We have the opportunity to do those things at several places on the website. Meaning, so you said, I multi cloud, right? IAC workflows that has a pulumi registry deployment component sections, or even the IAC workflows itself. The hero section can have in its own illustration or a video where we can do an iPad explanation also. But

Suresh Attaluri  32:27  
the message we can put here is, with plaid and code, you can rely on one app, but without Plato, you need to go,

Swarup Donepudi  32:35  
okay, so you're saying the without section will have multiple

Suresh Attaluri  32:39  
different tools that you need to interact, interact to get the work done that message we can,

Swarup Donepudi  32:50  
I don't know what's capable, what's possible. We need to wait until all of the synthesis is done, like chatgpt conversations happen, what it is going to give and what can we shall pull off, and then we can see if we can extend that to tell more story or less story. I don't know. I think again, this is a great discussion. We settled on the part of the landing page where we want to illustrate what is an internal developer platform, yes, with and without, with and without,

Suresh Attaluri  33:25  
that is a Yeah, with them. So in this conversation, chatgpt will give us recommendations. That's what Yes,

Suresh Attaluri  33:38  
expectation I.
