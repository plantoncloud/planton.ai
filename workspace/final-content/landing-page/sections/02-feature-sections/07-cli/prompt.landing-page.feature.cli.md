## Overall Goal

Okay, so what I'm trying to do right now is I am working on creating planton.ai, sales website. So far, I have made a
lot of progress and the overall structure of my workflow to create the website is, first of all, I came up with a site
map. So the Site Map includes the primary sections of the website structured around product features, product solution
as a solution, categorized by the company size, the role and use cases. So so the product has six primary features and a
few handful of solutions in each category. I have already finalized the content for each of the primary feature page,
each of the solution page. And the next goal in front of me is to finalize the content for the landing page. And the way
the landing page is structured is the landing page contains introduction about introductory feature. Sorry section for
each of the primary feature, introductory section for each of the category of the solution. And finally, a Call to
Action section. And the landing page will also have a hero section because I am working on, because I am working on
creating the landing page. I would need your help to create the content, and in the process, I am going to get you the
finalized content for each of the various sections, and I am also going to get you more information about the overall
goal that I am trying To solve with my product. And finally, you're going to give me one section at a time, so we both
are going to pair up and come up with the sections to include for each of the primary feature the solution category on
the landing page website, it is not necessary to add just one section for each of these primary feature or solution
categories. It is okay to add small one or two sections per feature now an important aspect to consider while doing this
exercise is we are a brand new product entering into the market, so the landing page should definitely make it Very
obvious for for the kind of problem that this project is aiming to solve for the target customers. And the target
customers for us are technology companies building software that is mobile or web applications and deploying to major
cloud providers. And the demographic for the customer profile is ranges from a single employed startup idea to growing
companies and larger enterprises. So I want you to make sure that while providing these sections for each of these
individual features, you also need to take into account the fact that when all of these various sections are going to be
placed on the landing page, they collectively should tell a really compelling story for our customers, while each of
these individual features are not directly going to convey the overall value proposition, the sections that we are going
to put on the landing page when the target customers go from top to bottom of the landing website. They should clearly
understand the value proposition that they can get with this, let's proceed.

As we work on each of these sections for the landing page, I am also going to give you the finalized version of the
previous sections so that you get to take into consideration all the previous section to build a compelling and
cohesive story, to ensure that the visitor of the landing page by the time he gets to the end of the landing page can
fully understand the value proposition the target customer profile that plan, ton cloud as an internal developer
platform is aiming to serve for.

## Problem Statement

Okay, so in today's technology companies where software is being developed, the software development as a concept has
become so complex, and the reason for the that is because the software development has moved from, or moved from
traditional data centers to cloud, and now with the exploration of AI tools, the overall number of tools that developers
are trying to leverage in order to put together a nice software working software, has gotten so complex, and This
probably is more severe as the company goes beyond a startup and starts to grow and expand their teams, and the problem
is far more see like apparent in larger organizations, even for startups going to market depends on how quickly the
software development can be done, and we are going to talk about a few bottlenecks in this whole process of software
development. So in most tech companies, regardless of their size, there will be some kind of an engineering leader. And
in a lot of tech startups, this will be the founder or co founder itself, right? And in like in growing companies, there
will be a CTO, or there may be a director of engineering, whatever so. And then there will be an architect or a senior
software engineer, Senior Software Engineer, and there is a chance that in startups, the founders are the founder or co
founder will also play this role, if it is a tech company, and the founders from a tech background, but you and these
architects of senior engineers will design this system, not just the initial design. They iteratively design the
software as it as it evolves, right and and in modern software development, this design is composed of several small
components, and these small components are called microservices. Now the organizations will have a group of developers.
If it is a startup, it can be it can range from one to five developers. And these developers do back end, they do front
end, they do mobile, etc. And these developers, they develop these micro services, as per the design. And these micro
services, the design also includes, not just the microservices, but the design will also require some third party open
source software. So TP osis examples could be Redis, post, press, etc. So these are, like popular open source
infrastructure that is most commonly found in any any design today, so these micro services directly depend on these
third party and again, moving in the transition to cloud, the design now also takes advantage of several of the managed
services that are provided by major pro providers or companies like Atlas for providing highly managed MongoDB or
confluent for highly managed Kafka or snowflake for its own databases, etc. So there are several managed services, and
then there are third party softwares that are not managed by anyone. So the organization which wants to manage or take
advantage of these open source they need to manage. The management includes deployment operations, etc. Now to help once
the system is developed, the system, in order for the software to be made available to those end users, it needs to be
deployed, right? And the deployment requires deployment of microservices, deployment of these open source and creation
of the managed services on the cloud providers, etc. So to help the developers take care of the process of deploying,
also during the deployment in modern software, these micro service components are built iteratively, right? So
iteratively, as in, small portion of the service gets developed, so small piece gets developed, and then it needs to be
pushed to GitHub so that rest of the team can take advantage of or understand the small modification done to a small
microservice, or a system can be composed of several microservices. So as developers contribute small changes to each of
these microservices, they an iteration is considered complete when that small. Change is published to GitHub and is also
deployed onto lower environment called demo environment. So this requires CICD, which has been around for a long time,
but that's that plays crucial role in this iterative development. As developers collaborate and start pushing tiny
changes, they the CICD is primarily of two steps, which is a bit automation, and then test automation and then
deployment automation. So three core tenants of SCD, so to help developers who are skilled at developing microservices
and to help them take care of the CAC part and finally deploying it on to the end infrastructure. The end infrastructure
is also required to be set up so the third another part of the organization comes into play, which is DevOps. Now these
developers and DevOps, they collaborate very actively during the whole process. And unfortunately, what is happening in
modern software companies is that every time a developer, developer requires something from the DevOps team, even for
most commonly used task, whether it be whether it is CICD or whether it is deploying of this third party open source
software because they need they need that as a dependency in their services, or the creation of any managed services
every time a developer interacts with another DevOps engineer. There are three ways people do do that, depending on the
maturity level of the automation implementation within organizations. One is ticket ops, and then another one is a part
semi partial self service via documentation or reusable TerraForm modules. And the fourth one is full self service
powered by portals built by platform engineers, right? So now, what is this maturity level? How is it different? Is if
it is ticket ops, let's say a developer wanting to deploy something, he creates a ticket and waits on the DevOps team
member. So if and remember, notice that each developer depends on the DevOps engineer, and someone takes their as the
number of developers grow, the number of developers, depending on DevOps engineers, will start to multiply, right? So
let's say the developer waits for the DevOps engineer to take a look at his request and fulfill the request, until then,
the developer gets blocked. So this is where the time is getting lost. Time spending waiting for the help from DevOps
engineers. And there is also more problems we'll talk about later, but this is the core problem that we are trying to
get. So the time spent inventing is the time spent lost in innovating or making productivity and eventually slows down
the feature delivery, and eventually it fits the revenue you you get behind the computation as organization suffers from
this time waiting at by several developers at ensemble DevOps Engineers, that leads to slower feature there will be that
leads to slower that basically makes the organization fall behind in the competition, and that eventually affects
revenue. It is probably slightly difficult to quantify how much revenue is lost because of this, because the amount of
time that gets wasted in these approach where is from situation to situation. Now, platform engineering is a concept
that is aiming to solve this bottleneck of this waiting so each everywhere there is waiting involved, platform
engineering is trying to hit that directly by building this, these Self Service portals that help developers to not
depend on DevOps engineers, where DevOps engineers or platform engineers create the automation, but also make it as a
self service usable with the concept of tea cops. Okay, so I think there is so much traction right now for platform
engineering and plant on cloud. The product that we have built is essentially a self service DevOps platform that works
out of the box so organizations can sign up and they can experience the Self Service DevOps like as if they had hired a
very high expertise platform engineering team, which has built a sophisticated portal for them. And another important
difference between other self service options that are available in the market versus plant and road is introducing yet
another portal for these developers. Is basically saying, hey, learn this one more tool and. That kind of probably is
very frustrated, more friction within the organization. So that's where we took advantage of conversational DevOps
powered by AI. So what this means is, imagine you have a instead of a portal, you have a chat chat bot that essentially
makes you that is 24 by seven available, which is equally capable as a platform engineer and understands your request in
natural language. Say, for example, you need a third party software deployed on Kubernetes. You can simply ask the
asking your conversation and natural language saying, hey, Redis deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, and this
conversation chatbot, it is, if it is capable of fulfilling your request on demand, right? When you need it, that's it.
That's amazing, right? Like, developers don't really need to learn new interfaces, etc. So that is one of the biggest
differences between plant upload, which is powered by AI, enables conversational DevOps. Concluding all of this plant on
Cloud, we think conversational DevOps is the future, and the future is here because plankton.ai now has fully
functioning conversational chat bot that can provide lots of lots of support for developers to develop their software
much faster, because they can get what they want Using those conversational interfaces right in the chat. However, there
is, as for bigger organizations, things done within the chat bot that kind of kills the transparency is a deal breaker,
because as the teams grow, there is a there will be a necessity to have transparent actions taken all over. So in case
of ticket ops, the transparency is enabled by the very nature of ticket ops. There are tickets, there is information
associated with who created ticket, who kind of served the ticket, mean who worked on the ticket, which is typically the
DevOps engineer. So there is so much information, and what are the steps taken during the ticket? And if any automation
has been executed for this ticket, they are associated with some GitHub actions, etc. And so there is so much governance
and administration there. And if somebody is asking for something like ticket, if the requester is not authorized to
request for it, then the whole system, there will be comments left by the engineer denying because of lack of
authorization. So now, how does this transition over in case of self services, whichever self service system that the
organization is deploying to take care of this bottleneck that kind of wastes device precious development time, should
also take take care of enabling transparency and only performing the operations on authorization. So governance and
administration and transparency are key. So for to support all of that, regardless of what operations are performed in
the conversational chatbot, everything is surfaced as part of the optical intelligence where every configuration change
is captured as a git diff and is and the whole history of configuration changes is available on as a Version History
against each of the several components that are that make up this entire software, and for every change that is made to
the configuration, if it is related to a deployment, whether it is a micro service deployment or a third party OSS
deployment, or to Kubernetes or other infrastructure, or whether it is a managed a component that is created on a
managed service. All of the configuration changes are deployed using pulumi modules. So in Planck road chat bot, so the
pulumi module stack job, we call them a stack job. So stack jobs, even though those are created as part of the
conversational chat stacks, those captured as stack jobs history. Every stack job is preserved, whether it is created
from conversation, chapter or outside, and that enables provides lots of governance and auditability, because every
change captured as version history also has a corresponding stack job. And there will be a way for anyone to take a look
at how the configuration change impacted the infrastructure, because the pulumi operations persisted on the platform
also persist all the diffs produced by pulumi CMI. And so that is the problem that we are trying to solve. So with plant
on cloud. So as we are trying to build the sales website and trying to build the messaging portion to position plant on
Cloud as a rock solid solution for to solve this bottleneck, we are, we are constantly iterating, and I think at this
point it's safe to say that the positioning or the title that we, I am very comfortable with, is conversational DevOps
is the future. Future is here. So I am hoping that with this explanation, I can get more help from either any AI tool or
anyone who is experienced in building compelling sales messages. If they understand this narrative and can help me
create content on the sales website.

## Intro Video Script

I am also sharing here a draft of a script that I wrote to create an introductory video for the product which many give
you more information about the problem space.

### Script

The world of software development has gotten so complex in today's cloud native.

but fortunately, a consistency has evolved.

organizations building technology products have architects/senior engineers who design the system and in most cases
these architectures are composed of various tiny components called as microservices. organizations hire software
developers who then start developing these microservices. these microservices are developed iteratively. each iteration
to complete required continuous integration. build and deployment automations enable efficient and quick iterations.

these microservices also depend on third party open source software, managed cloud services. finally all these
components need to be deployed somewhere. that is where the operations team steps in to help developers. these
operations teams are incharge of the cloud services that provide nuts and bolts i.e compute, network and storage
required to run these microservices, third-party services and managed cloud-services.

problems:

- build and deployment automations - historically, ops teams took care of these automations. but now, developers are
  responsible for these automations i.e shift left.
- every time a developers is waiting for the ops team, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is digging through the documentation to identify the ownership of a service that their service
  depends on, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to deploy their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to scale their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to monitor their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to secure their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to troubleshoot their service in remote environment, it is a waste
  of time.

end result:

unhappy developers, lost productivity, unhappy customers, lost revenue.

solution:

- developers should be able to deploy their service on their own.
- developers should be able to scale their service on their own.
- developers should be able to monitor their service on their own.
- developers should be able to secure their service on their own.
- developers should be able to troubleshoot their service in remote environment on their own.
- developers should be able to do all of the above without having to dig through the documentation.
- developers should be able to do all of the above without having to wait for the ops team.
