### Section 1: The Complexity of Ingress Setup in Modern Deployments

**Description:**

Setting up ingress for applications in cloud-native environments presents significant challenges. Traditional methods
demand managing dynamic IP addresses, configuring DNS records, and ensuring secure external access to servicesâ€”tasks
that require deep networking expertise. This complexity often leads to time-consuming processes and increases the risk
of misconfigurations, hindering deployment efficiency and placing a heavy burden on development teams.
