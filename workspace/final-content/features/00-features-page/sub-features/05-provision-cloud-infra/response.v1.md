### **Consistent Deployment for Applications and Infrastructure**

**Description:**

Deployment automation tools often excel at handling applications like web apps and APIs but fall short when it comes to
cloud infrastructure provisioning. Planton Cloud extends its deployment framework to include cloud resources such as
compute instances, storage buckets, and network services. This unified approach provides a consistent and streamlined
experience, reducing cognitive load and enhancing productivity for developers working in cloud-native environments.

**Comparison with Status Quo:**

Traditional methods require separate tools and complex configurations for infrastructure provisioning, leading to
fragmented workflows and increased frustration. Planton Cloud simplifies this process by offering a single platform for
deploying both applications and infrastructure.

### **Simplified Provisioning with Pre-Built Pulumi Modules**

**Description:**

Generic solutions for infrastructure deployment often involve unstructured forms and require extensive manual input,
making the process cumbersome. Planton Cloud addresses this by providing carefully modeled inputs and pre-built Pulumi
modules for popular workloads. This refined approach tailors the deployment process to specific components, resulting in
a smoother and more intuitive experience for developers.

**Comparison with Status Quo:**

While generic tools demand in-depth expertise and manual configurations, Planton Cloud's use of pre-built modules and
simplified input forms accelerates deployment and minimizes errors.

### **Multi-Cloud Flexibility with Customizable Provisioning**

**Description:**

Adopting a multi-cloud strategy is often hindered by the lack of in-house expertise across different cloud providers.
Planton Cloud empowers organizations to overcome this limitation by leveraging default Pulumi modules that abstract the
complexities of various cloud services. Additionally, a Pulumi registry allows DevOps engineers to customize
provisioning logic, tailoring deployments to complex environments and specific organizational needs.

**Comparison with Status Quo:**

Organizations traditionally remain tied to a single cloud provider due to expertise constraints. Planton Cloud
facilitates multi-cloud adoption without the need for specialized knowledge in each platform, offering greater
flexibility and scalability.
