![Screenshot illustrating GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) in action. The left side shows a line graph tracking the number of vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Moderate, Low) over time, with data points from January 1 to February 15, 2024. The right side displays a security bot's recommendation to fix a vulnerability in the code. The bot explains that user-provided input is being used in an HTTP response without sanitization, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The AI-suggested fix involves using the escape-html library to sanitize the input, with the old code in red and the new, corrected code in green.
