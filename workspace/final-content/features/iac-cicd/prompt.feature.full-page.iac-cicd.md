I am now providing a full transcription of a video recording i made explaining all the capabilities of
`Built-In IaC Workflows`. We are going to work together to create a full feature for this feature. Please feel free to use
whatever vocabulary is more appropriate for the titles and description based on the provided transcriptions and other
inputs.

I need you to give me 3 options for hero section, 10 page sections with titles and
their descriptions and additional notes that i can use for crafting a visualization for that section.

So, the focus here is only about full feature page for "Built-In IaC Workflows".

I am also sharing few key aspects to consider as guidelines when generating the content for the feature page.

Most importantly put yourself in the role of a highly skilled developer tooling sales messaging creation expert for this
task.

it is not mandatory that you will use "Built-In IaC Workflows". I named it based on my own knowledge and I am an engineer
and not a sales expert. I would like to critical question my recommendations and generate the content based on the terms
that make more sense from a sales perspective. You are the expert here. not me. My inputs for titles are only
recommendations based on my understanding.
