Let’s consider a scenario where a developer needs to create DynamoDB table.

Typically, they would need support from DevOps team.

But let’s see how the developer can self-service the same request using Plantora.

let's start a new conversation, where we can request the DynamoDB table.

Here is the request—no lengthy scripts, no specialized tooling. Just a quick message describing what we want.

We’ll provide the table name, hash key, and confirm it’s for staging.

Plantora summarizes the configuration and waits for our approval. 

You can see the real-time deployment progress here. 

Plantora orchestrates everything behind the scenes—without any DevOps ticket. 

Once the deployment is completed, you’ll see the newly created DynamoDB table on AWS console. 

And that’s how Plantora helps developers to self-service what they need — like provisioning a DynamoDB table.

Thanks for watching, and happy building!
