# VIDEO SCRIPT (Approx. 2 Minutes Total)
## INTRODUCTION (Scenario Setup + Action)
(Action) – Open AWS Console, Show DynamoDB Tables
On Screen: Begin your screen recording in the AWS Management Console under the DynamoDB section.
Voiceover (while navigating):
Let’s consider a scenario where a developer needs to create a DynamoDB table to store some application data.
Typically, they’d need support from the DevOps team—opening a ticket and waiting.
But let’s see how the developer can self-service the same request using Plantora’s co-pilot.

(If you have no existing tables, just show the empty list. If you have tables, briefly note that “user-sessions” does not exist.)

## 1) PROVISIONING DEMO (0:00 – 1:00)
  ### (Action 1) – Open Plantora Console
  On Screen: Switch your browser/tab to the Plantora console.
  #### Voiceover (while performing the action):
  “Now, I’m heading over to the Plantora console. This is our AI-powered DevOps co-pilot where we can create cloud resources with simple chat prompts.”

  ### (Action 2) – Click “Ask Plantora”
  On Screen: Move your cursor and click the “Ask Plantora” (or equivalent) button to start a new chat.
  ### Voiceover (while clicking):
  “I’ll click ‘Ask Plantora’ to start a new conversation, where I can request the DynamoDB table.”

  ### (Action 3) – Type Request
  On Screen: In the chat, type:
```
I need an AWS DynamoDB table for our staging environment.
```
  ### Voiceover (as or right after typing):
  “Here’s the request—no lengthy scripts, no specialized tooling. Just a quick message describing what I want.”

  ### (Action 4) – Bot Prompts for Details
  On Screen: Plantora responds with a prompt asking for resource name, environment name, hash key name, etc.
  ### Voiceover (once the prompt appears):
  “Plantora then asks for a few important details, so I don’t have to memorize any AWS-specific parameters.”

  ### (Action 5) – Fill in the Details
  On Screen: You type:
```
Table name is user-sessions
Hash Key Name is session-id
Hash Key Type is S
name is user-sessions
environment name is staging
```
  ### Voiceover (while or just after typing):
  “I’ll provide the table name, hash key, and confirm it’s for staging. Everything happens here in one conversation.”

  ### (Action 6) – Confirm Provisioning
  On Screen: Plantora displays a “final state” or summary, then asks for confirmation. You type:
```
Yes, proceed.
```
  ### Voiceover (as you confirm):
  “Plantora summarizes the configuration and waits for my approval. I’ll say ‘Yes, proceed,’ and it handles the AWS deployment automatically.”

  ### (Action 7) – Show Real-Time Progress
  On Screen: The chat shows “Deploying…” or “Creating DynamoDB table…” then “Deployment Complete!”
  ### Voiceover (after the logs appear):
  “You can see the real-time progress here. Plantora is orchestrating everything behind the scenes—no DevOps tickets needed.”

  ### (Action 8) – Optional Console Check
  On Screen: Briefly switch back to the AWS console to verify “user-sessions” exists now.
  ### Voiceover (while verifying):
“And that’s how Plantora’s co-pilot helps developers self-service common DevOps requests—like provisioning a DynamoDB table—quickly and securely.
Thanks for watching, and happy building!”
