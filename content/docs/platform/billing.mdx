# Billing and Subscriptions

## Simple, Transparent Pricing for Modern Teams

We believe infrastructure automation should be accessible to everyone—from solo developers to large enterprises. That's why our pricing is straightforward: pay per developer seat, get generous automation minutes included, and scale as you grow.

> **The Pricing Promise**: No hidden fees, no surprise bills, no complex calculators. Just honest pricing that scales with your team.

## How Billing Works

Planton Cloud uses a hybrid pricing model that's both predictable and fair:

    A[Subscription] --> B[Per Seat Cost]
    A --> C[Included Minutes]
    
    D[Usage] --> E[Automation Minutes]
    E --> F[Overage Charges]
    
    B --> G[Monthly Bill]
    C --> G
    F --> G

    style D fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Two components**:
1. **Subscription Fee**: Based on number of seats (team members)
2. **Usage Charges**: Based on automation minutes used

## Understanding Automation Minutes

### What Are Automation Minutes?

Automation minutes track the compute time used by:
- **Build Minutes**: Creating container images in pipelines
- **Deployment Minutes**: Running Stack Jobs for infrastructure

They measure actual execution time, not wall clock time.

### What Counts as Minutes

#### Build Minutes (ServiceHub)
```
Git Push → Pipeline Starts → Timer Starts
  │
  ├─ Clone Repository (0.5 min)
  ├─ Build Container (3 min)
  ├─ Push to Registry (0.5 min)
  │
  └─ Timer Stops = 4 minutes used
```

#### Deployment Minutes (InfraHub)
```
Deploy Resource → Stack Job Starts → Timer Starts
  │
  ├─ Terraform Init (0.2 min)
  ├─ Terraform Plan (0.5 min)
  ├─ Terraform Apply (2.3 min)
  │
  └─ Timer Stops = 3 minutes used
```

### What Doesn't Count

- Viewing the console
- Managing team members
- Creating configurations
- Waiting for approvals
- Reading logs
- Platform overhead

### Tracking Usage

Monitor your usage in real-time:

1. Go to **Billing** in sidebar
2. See current month usage
3. View historical trends
4. Set up usage alerts

> **Screenshot Placeholder**: Billing dashboard showing usage graph

## Billing Cycles and Payment

### Monthly Billing

- **Billing Period**: Calendar month
- **Payment Date**: 1st of each month
- **Usage Reset**: Monthly
- **Proration**: Yes, for mid-month changes

### How Charges Are Calculated

```
Monthly Bill = Subscription + Overage

Where:
- Subscription = Number of Seats × Tier Price
- Overage = Max(0, Used Minutes - Included Minutes) × $0.06
```

**Example (Plus Tier, 5 developers, 400 minutes used)**:
```
Subscription: 5 seats × $19 = $95
Included: 300 minutes
Overage: 400 - 300 = 100 minutes × $0.06 = $6
Total: $95 + $6 = $101
```

### Payment Methods

**Accepted**:
- Credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex)
- ACH/Wire (Enterprise only)
- Annual prepayment (discount available)

**Not accepted**:
- PayPal
- Cryptocurrency
- Purchase orders (except Enterprise)

## Cost Optimization

### Monitor Usage Patterns

```yaml
High Usage Areas:
  - Large Docker builds
  - Complex Terraform deployments
  - Frequent rebuilds
  - Multiple environments
```

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Optimize Build Times
- Use build caching
- Minimize Docker layers
- Use efficient base images
- Enable incremental builds

#### 2. Reduce Deployment Frequency
- Batch changes together
- Use preview environments wisely
- Implement good testing
- Avoid unnecessary refreshes

#### 3. Right-Size Resources
- Don't over-provision
- Use auto-scaling
- Clean up unused resources
- Consolidate similar resources

### Usage Alerts

Set up notifications:
```yaml
Alert Thresholds:
  - 50% of included minutes
  - 80% of included minutes
  - 100% of included minutes
  - Every 100 overage minutes
```
