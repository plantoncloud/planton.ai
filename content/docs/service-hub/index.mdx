# ServiceHub

## Your Command Center for Modern Application Delivery

Remember when deploying code meant SSH-ing into servers, running scripts, and crossing your fingers? Or maybe you're currently maintaining a maze of CI/CD pipelines across different tools? ServiceHub changes all that.

ServiceHub is Planton Cloud's answer to the question: "Why can't deploying backend services be as simple as pushing to Vercel?" It's where your code meets the cloud, automatically and intelligently.

> **The ServiceHub Promise:** Push code to Git, get production deployments. No YAML wrestling, no pipeline debugging, no sleepless nights.

## What ServiceHub Does

Think of ServiceHub as your application delivery platform that handles the entire journey from code to cloud:

### ðŸ“¦ Services
**Connect Git repos & configure builds**  
Define what to build, from where, and how. Support for monorepos, custom triggers, and more.

### ðŸ”„ Pipelines
**Automated CI/CD workflows**  
Every commit triggers intelligent pipelines that build, test, and deploy your applications.

### ðŸš€ Deployments
**Multi-cloud, multi-platform delivery**  
Deploy to Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or anywhere else your apps need to live.

## The Developer Experience You Deserve

ServiceHub was born from a simple frustration: why is deploying applications still so hard? Here's how we've made it better:

### 1. **Connect Once, Deploy Forever**
```bash
# Traditional approach
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure build scripts  
- Set up deployment scripts
- Configure webhooks
- Manage secrets
- Debug failed builds
- Repeat for each service...

# ServiceHub approach
- Connect your repo
- Push code
- Done.
```

### 2. **Intelligent Defaults, Full Control**

We make smart decisions so you don't have to, but give you escape hatches when you need them:

- **Auto-detect** your language and framework
- **Auto-build** using Cloud Native Buildpacks
- **Auto-deploy** to your configured environments
- **But also:** Bring your own Dockerfile, your own pipelines, your own everything if needed

### 3. **Monorepo-First Design**

Real applications aren't always neat single-repo projects. ServiceHub embraces complexity:

- Configure multiple services from one repository
- Set up smart triggers so only relevant services rebuild
- Use sparse checkout for faster clones
- Share code between services without deployment headaches

## How ServiceHub Fits in Planton Cloud

ServiceHub is one part of the larger Planton Cloud ecosystem:

- **InfraHub** provisions the infrastructure where your services run
- **ServiceHub** builds and deploys your applications to that infrastructure  
- **Secrets Manager** provides runtime configuration
- **IAM** controls who can deploy what, where

## ServiceHub by the Numbers

Here's what ServiceHub enables under the hood:

- **< 30 seconds** from commit to pipeline start
- **Zero-config** builds for 8+ major languages  
- **Parallel builds** for monorepo services
- **Preview environments** for pull requests
- **Multi-cloud** deployment targets
- **Complete observability** of your build and deploy process

## Why Developers Love ServiceHub

> "It's like Vercel and Heroku had a baby, but for serious backend services. Push code, get deployments. Finally." - *A happy developer*

> "We went from 45-minute Jenkins pipelines to 5-minute ServiceHub builds. Our monorepo with 12 services just works." - *Platform team lead*

> "The preview environments for PRs changed how we do code reviews. Seeing is believing." - *Frontend developer*
