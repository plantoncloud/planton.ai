## From Zero to Deployed in 5 Minutes

Let's get your first service running on Planton Cloud. By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Connected your Git repository
- Configured automatic builds
- Deployed your application
- Got a live URL (optional)

> **Prerequisites**: You'll need a Planton Cloud account and a Git repository (GitHub or GitLab) with some code to deploy.

## Step 1: Connect Your Git Provider

First, let's connect your GitHub or GitLab account so Planton Cloud can access your repositories.

### GitHub

```bash
# Using the CLI
planton connect github

# This will:
# 1. Open your browser for OAuth authorization
# 2. Request permissions to read repos and create webhooks
# 3. Store the connection securely
```

### GitLab

```bash
# Using the CLI
planton connect gitlab

# This will:
# 1. Open your browser for OAuth authorization
# 2. Request permissions to read repos and create webhooks
# 3. Store the connection securely
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Service

Now let's create a Service. We'll use a simple Node.js app as an example, but this works with any language.

### Using the CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive service creation
planton service create

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Service name: my-api
# - Repository: Select from your repos
# - Build method: Choose 'buildpacks' for auto-detection
# - Enable ingress?: Yes (to get a public URL)
```

### Using a YAML File

If you prefer declarative configuration:

```yaml
# service.yaml
apiVersion: service-hub.planton.cloud/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-api
  org: my-org
spec:
  description: My first service on Planton Cloud
  git_repo:
    owner_name: myusername
    name: my-nodejs-api
    git_repo_provider: github
  pipeline_configuration:
    pipeline_provider: platform
    image_build_method: buildpacks
    image_repository_path: my-org/my-api
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    dns_domain_id: my-domain-id  # from 'planton dns-domain list'
```

Then apply it:

```bash
planton apply -f service.yaml
```

## Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen

As soon as you create the service, Planton Cloud:

1. **Creates a webhook** on your repository
2. **Triggers the first pipeline** for your default branch
3. **Builds your application** (auto-detecting language/framework)
4. **Creates a container image**
5. **Deploys to your environment**

Watch the progress:

```bash
# Follow pipeline logs
planton service logs my-api --follow

# Check service status
planton service status my-api
```

## Step 4: Push Code and See It Deploy

Now for the fun part. Make a change to your code and push:

```bash
# In your repository
echo "// Deployed with Planton Cloud!" >> index.js
git add index.js
git commit -m "feat: testing auto-deployment"
git push
```

Within seconds, you'll see:
- A new pipeline starting
- Your code building
- The new version deploying
- Your app updated (usually under 5 minutes total)

> **Pro tip**: Keep `planton service logs my-api --follow` running in another terminal to watch deployments in real-time.

## Step 5: Access Your Service

If you enabled ingress, your service is now accessible at:

```
https://my-api.your-domain.com
```

Get the exact URL:

```bash
planton service url my-api
```

## Common Patterns and Examples

### Node.js Express API

No configuration needed! Just push your code:

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Planton Cloud!' });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Auto-detected as Node.js** | **Port automatically configured**

### Python Flask App

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello from Planton Cloud!"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))
```

**Auto-detected as Python** | **Dependencies from requirements.txt**

### Go API

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Planton Cloud!")
    })

    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "8080"
    }

    http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
}
```

**Auto-detected as Go** | **Efficient multi-stage builds**

## Customizing Your Service

### Using a Dockerfile

If buildpacks don't meet your needs, bring your own Dockerfile:

```yaml
pipeline_configuration:
  image_build_method: dockerfile  # Instead of buildpacks
```

Just make sure you have a `Dockerfile` in your repository root (or project root if configured).

### Monorepo Setup

Have multiple services in one repo? Configure the project root:

```yaml
git_repo:
  project_root: backend/api  # Service lives here
  trigger_paths:
    - "backend/api/**"      # Only build when these change
    - "shared/**"           # And these shared libs
```

### Environment Variables

Add configuration through Secrets Groups:

```bash
# Create a secrets group
planton secrets-group create api-secrets

# Add secrets
planton secrets-group add-secret api-secrets DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
planton secrets-group add-secret api-secrets API_KEY="sk-..."

# Attach to your service
planton service attach-secrets my-api api-secrets
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Build fails with "no buildpack detected"

Make sure your repository has recognizable files:
- Node.js: `package.json`
- Python: `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`
- Go: `go.mod`
- Java: `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`

Or switch to Dockerfile-based builds.

### Container crashes immediately

Check that your app listens on the `PORT` environment variable:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // Always use process.env.PORT
```

### Webhook not triggering builds

Verify the webhook is active:
```bash
planton service webhook-status my-api
```

Re-create if needed:
```bash
planton service recreate-webhook my-api
```
