### Infrastructure Concepts
- **Lego Blocks**: Individual cloud resources (VPC, RDS, EKS)
- **Infra Charts**: Collections of resources that work together
- **Stack Jobs**: Automated workflows that deploy infrastructure
- **Flow Control**: Policies governing deployment behavior

### Application Concepts
- **Services**: Your applications from Git repositories
- **Pipelines**: Automated build and deploy workflows
- **Build Methods**: Buildpacks (auto-detect) or Dockerfile
- **Deployments**: Where your applications run
