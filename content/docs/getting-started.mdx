# Planton Documentation

## Summary
Welcome — this section helps you get from zero to a working Planton Cloud setup. It’s CLI‑first, concise, and points you directly to the source of truth in this workspace when you want details.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ for local web apps (only if you want to run the `planton.ai` site)
- Git and a recent macOS/Linux shell
- Planton CLI binary or ability to build it from source

> Note: The CLI is the primary interface to Planton Cloud. Source lives under `planton-cloud/client-apps/cli`. See the domain packages under `planton-cloud/client-apps/cli/cmd/planton/root/domain/*`.

## Steps
1. Clone the repos you’ll use side‑by‑side.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plantoncloud-inc/planton-cloud
git clone https://github.com/plantoncloud/project-planton
git clone https://github.com/plantoncloud/planton.ai
```

2. Get the CLI.

```bash
# Option A: Use a prebuilt binary from the repo
ls planton-cloud/client-apps/cli/build

# Option B: Build from source (see targets and Makefile in the CLI folder)
cd planton-cloud/client-apps/cli
# Examples: check available commands/targets
grep -R "cobra.Command" -n cmd/planton | head -n 20 | cat
```

3. Verify the CLI and set your working context.

```bash
planton version
planton context get
# Example: set org and environment (see flags in cmd/planton/root/context/*.go)
planton context set --org <your-org> --env <dev|staging|prod>
```

4. Explore the main domains from the CLI.

- **Infra Hub**: one‑click provisioning orchestration that composes platform APIs with Project Planton legoblocks.
  - Sources: `planton-cloud/backend/services/infra-hub` and protobufs under `planton-cloud/apis/cloud/planton/**`
  - Legoblocks: `project-planton/apis/project/planton/provider/<provider>/<legoblock>/`

- **ServiceHub**: build and deploy pipelines for your services (Vercel‑like developer experience).
  - Sources: `planton-cloud/backend/services/service-hub` and protobufs under `planton-cloud/apis/cloud/planton/**`

## Examples
```bash
# Check your CLI version
planton version

# Inspect current execution context
planton context get

# Update context (flags available under cmd/planton/root/context)
planton context set --org acmecorp --env dev
```

## Troubleshooting
> Note: If a command isn’t recognized, confirm you’re executing the correct binary for your platform from `planton-cloud/client-apps/cli/build` or that your `$PATH` includes it.

- **Auth or API connectivity issues**: The CLI uses gRPC clients defined under `planton-cloud/client-apps/cli/internal/cli/backend` and related packages. Ensure your credentials and endpoint environment variables are configured.
- **Provisioning questions**: Cross‑check the exact legoblock under `project-planton/apis/project/planton/provider/...` and the Infra Hub service logic under `backend/services/infra-hub` for accurate parameters and defaults.

## Next steps
- Explore features and deeper guides in this `/docs` section as they land.
- Share missing topics or questions and we’ll link to the exact sources here.
