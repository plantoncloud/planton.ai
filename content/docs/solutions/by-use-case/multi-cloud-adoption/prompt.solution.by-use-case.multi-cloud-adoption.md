**Objective:**

We are redesigning our website, transitioning from **planton.cloud** to **planton.ai**, to reflect the current state
of our product, **Planton Cloud**. The new website should showcase all features developed since our initial launch in
December 2023, with a strong emphasis on the AI capabilities integrated into the platform.

**Team Overview:**

- **Product Owner:** *Swarup Donepudi* (myself) — Deep understanding of the product end-to-end.
- **UX Designer:** *Irshad* — Skilled in Figma, designed the first version of Planton Cloud, needs detailed input to
  effectively apply design thinking.
- **Web Developers:** *Satish and Paul* — Experts in React and Next.js, responsible for translating designs into a
  functional website deployed via Vercel.

**Previous Approach and Insights:**

- Initially attempted a creative, ground-up website design but faced challenges due to limited experience.
- Shifted strategy to model our website after a single, developer-focused platform: **GitHub.com**.
    - **GitHub's Structure Insights:**
        - **Header Navigation:** Features "Products" with primary features (e.g., Copilot, Security), "Solutions," and
          other tabs.
        - **Homepage Flow:** After the hero section, each primary feature is highlighted in sequence, linking to
          detailed pages.
        - **Dedicated Feature Pages:** In-depth information about each primary feature.
        - **"All Features" Page:** Lists secondary features that support or enhance the primary ones.

**Current Strategy:**

- Conduct in-depth discussions on each major and minor feature of Planton Cloud.
- Refine these discussions into concise transcriptions.
- Identify Planton Cloud's primary and secondary features, mirroring GitHub's structure.
- Develop section titles, descriptions, and decide on visuals/screenshots for each feature.
- Provide a comprehensive overview of GitHub.com's features for reference.

**Your Role and Request:**

As ChatGPT, we need your assistance to:

1. **Analyze Refined Transcriptions:**
    - Extract and identify the primary and secondary features of Planton Cloud.
    - Understand the value propositions these features offer to developers.

2. **Develop Website Content:**
    - Suggest appropriate section titles for both primary and secondary features.
    - Craft concise and compelling write-ups for each feature, suitable for website content.
    - Recommend visuals or screenshots that effectively illustrate each feature.

3. **Guide Implementation:**
    - Provide insights on structuring the website to enhance user experience.
    - Advise on best practices for communicating complex technical features to a developer audience.

**Outcome Expected:**

- A clear outline of website sections that align with our product's strengths and the interests of our developer
  audience.
- Content that emphasizes our AI integrations and recent developments.
- A cohesive design and content strategy that our UX designer and developers can implement efficiently.

**Additional Context:**

- We will supply you with detailed overviews and comparisons of GitHub.com's features and structure.
- The goal is to create a website that resonates with developers, showcasing depth and utility, much like GitHub.com
  does.

Please use this information to understand our requirements and assist us in designing the sections of our new website.

Do not jump to start providing content. We need to first analyze the features and structure before proceeding to
content. So, I will give you all the input that I think is required for you achieve this goal right now incrementally.
Once I share all the input I have then I will ask you to provide me specific content with in the website. So, we are
going to collaborate and build one page after the other and develop the hero section, sections with in the page along
with their titles and description. We will move to another page only after I confirm that I am happy with the current
page.

Here is the list of all pages that we need to build:

Landing Page
Product - Dedicated Individual Pages for Primary Features
Features Page
CLI Page (although not a primary feature, a dedicated page is good) we will add it among the primary features on the
landing page as well.
Solutions - Solutions Overview Page
Solutions - By UseCase - DevOps Page
Solutions - By UseCase - ChatOps Page
Solutions - By UseCase - Internal Developer Platform Page
Solutions - By UseCase - Multi-cloud Page
Solutions - By UseCase - (Add other use cases as applicable)
Solutions - By Size - Startups Page
Solutions - By Size - Small and Medium Teams Page
Solutions - By Size - Enterprises Page
Open Source - Project Planton Page
Open Source -Pulumi Modules Page
Pricing Page

I am now providing a full transcription of a video recording i made explaining the concept of 'Multi-Cloud Adotpion' and
How PlantonCloud offers a great solution for Organization who want to embrace Multi-Cloud. Note that I calling it as a "
Solution" and not "Feature". So, your content you are going to generate should be in line with that.

We are going to work together to create a full page for this "solution". Please feel free to use whatever vocabulary is
more appropriate for the titles and description based on the provided transcriptions and other inputs.

I need you to give me 3 options for hero section, 10 page sections with titles and
their descriptions and additional notes that i can use for crafting a visualization for that section.

So, the focus here is only about full feature page for "Multi-Cloud Adoption(as Solution)".

I am also sharing few key aspects to consider as guidelines when generating the content for the feature page.

Most importantly put yourself in the role of a highly skilled developer tooling sales messaging creation expert for this
task.
