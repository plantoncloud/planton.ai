# Deploying Applications on AWS EC2 Instances

AWS EC2 has revolutionized how we deploy applications. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready EC2 deployments that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Instance architecture design
- Security best practices
- Auto-scaling setup
- Load balancing
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AWS EC2
- AWS CLI configured
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your application stack

## Step 1: Design Your Instance Architecture

Start with a well-structured instance configuration:

```yaml
Resources:
  WebServerInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t3.medium
      ImageId: ami-12345678
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - !Ref WebServerSecurityGroup
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64: !Sub |
          #!/bin/bash
          yum update -y
          yum install -y httpd
          systemctl start httpd
          systemctl enable httpd
```

## Step 2: Implement Security Groups

Use proper security group configurations:

```yaml
  WebServerSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Security group for web server
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 80
          ToPort: 80
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 443
          ToPort: 443
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```
