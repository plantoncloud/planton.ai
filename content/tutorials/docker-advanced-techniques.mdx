# Advanced Docker Techniques for Microservices

Docker has revolutionized how we package and deploy applications. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready Docker containers that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Writing efficient Dockerfiles
- Security best practices
- Multi-stage builds
- Image optimization
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Docker
- Docker installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your application stack

## Step 1: Optimize Your Dockerfile

Start with a well-structured Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use specific base image versions
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first for better caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
USER nodejs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Use exec form for CMD
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Step 2: Implement Multi-Stage Builds

Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app

# Install only production dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
```
