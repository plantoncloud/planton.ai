# Advanced CI/CD Pipeline Strategies

CI/CD has revolutionized how we deploy applications. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready CI/CD pipelines that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Pipeline architecture design
- Security best practices
- Multi-environment deployment
- Testing strategies
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of CI/CD
- CI/CD tools installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your deployment stack

## Step 1: Design Your Pipeline Architecture

Start with a well-structured pipeline:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security-scan
  - deploy-staging
  - integration-test
  - deploy-production
```

## Step 2: Implement Security Scanning

Use proper security checks in your pipeline:

```yaml
security-scan:
  stage: security-scan
  script:
    - npm audit
    - snyk test
    - trivy image $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```
