# Kubernetes Networking Deep Dive

Kubernetes networking has revolutionized how we connect services. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready networking configurations that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Service architecture design
- Network policies
- Ingress configuration
- Service mesh setup
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Kubernetes
- Kubernetes cluster running
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your networking stack

## Step 1: Design Your Service Architecture

Start with a well-structured service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

## Step 2: Implement Network Policies

Use proper network security policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```
