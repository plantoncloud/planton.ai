# Setting Up a Production Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes has revolutionized how we orchestrate and deploy applications. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready Kubernetes clusters that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Cluster architecture design
- Security best practices
- High availability setup
- Monitoring and logging
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Kubernetes
- Kubernetes installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your application stack

## Step 1: Design Your Cluster Architecture

Start with a well-structured cluster design:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: production-cluster
spec:
  nodes:
    - name: master-1
      role: control-plane
    - name: worker-1
      role: worker
    - name: worker-2
      role: worker
```

## Step 2: Implement Security Policies

Use RBAC and network policies for security:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: app-developer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```
