# Building Reusable Terraform Modules

Terraform has revolutionized how we manage infrastructure. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready Terraform modules that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Module structure design
- Variable and output patterns
- Security best practices
- Testing strategies
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Terraform
- Terraform installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your infrastructure stack

## Step 1: Design Your Module Structure

Start with a well-structured module:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  
  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  environment = "production"
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

## Step 2: Implement Security Policies

Use proper variable validation and security groups:

```hcl
variable "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for VPC"
  type = string
  validation {
    condition = can(cidrhost(var.vpc_cidr, 0))
    error_message = "Must be a valid CIDR block"
  }
}
```
