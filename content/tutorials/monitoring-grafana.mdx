# Setting Up Grafana Dashboards for Monitoring

Grafana has revolutionized how we visualize monitoring data. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready Grafana dashboards that are informative, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Dashboard design principles
- Panel configuration
- Data source integration
- Alerting setup
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of monitoring
- Grafana installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your monitoring stack

## Step 1: Design Your Dashboard Layout

Start with a well-structured dashboard:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "Production Overview",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "CPU Usage",
        "type": "graph",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "cpu_usage_percent"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Configure Data Sources

Set up proper data source connections:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: grafana-datasources
data:
  datasources.yaml: |
    apiVersion: 1
    datasources:
    - name: Prometheus
      type: prometheus
      url: http://prometheus:9090
```
