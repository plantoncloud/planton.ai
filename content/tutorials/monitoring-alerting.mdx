# Setting Up Monitoring and Alerting Systems

Monitoring and alerting has revolutionized how we respond to incidents. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready monitoring systems that are informative, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Alert rule design
- Escalation policies
- Incident response
- On-call management
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of monitoring
- Monitoring tools installed
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your monitoring stack

## Step 1: Design Your Alert Rules

Start with a well-structured alert configuration:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: infrastructure
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: cpu_usage_percent > 80
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage is above 80% for 5 minutes"
```

## Step 2: Configure Escalation Policies

Set up proper notification channels:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'team-oncall'
    slack_configs:
      - channel: '#alerts'
        send_resolved: true
    pagerduty_configs:
      - service_key: 'your-service-key'
```
