# Deploying Serverless Functions with AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda has revolutionized how we deploy serverless functions. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready Lambda functions that are secure, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Function architecture design
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring strategies
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AWS Lambda
- AWS CLI configured
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your serverless stack

## Step 1: Design Your Function Architecture

Start with a well-structured function:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    const result = await processEvent(event);
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(result)
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message })
    };
  }
};
```

## Step 2: Implement Security Policies

Use proper IAM roles and security groups:

```yaml
Resources:
  LambdaExecutionRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              Service: lambda.amazonaws.com
            Action: sts:AssumeRole
```
