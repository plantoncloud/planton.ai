## Database Architecture Patterns

### 1. Single Database vs. Distributed Systems

Choose the right architecture for your needs:

```yaml
architecture_patterns:
  single_database:
    use_case: "Small to medium applications"
    pros:
      - "Simple to manage"
      - "ACID compliance"
      - "Lower operational overhead"
    cons:
      - "Limited scalability"
      - "Single point of failure"
      - "Performance bottlenecks"
  
  read_replicas:
    use_case: "Read-heavy applications"
    pros:
      - "Improved read performance"
      - "Geographic distribution"
      - "Load distribution"
    cons:
      - "Eventual consistency"
      - "Increased complexity"
      - "Higher costs"
  
  sharding:
    use_case: "Large-scale applications"
    pros:
      - "Horizontal scalability"
      - "Better performance"
      - "Fault isolation"
    cons:
      - "Complex queries"
      - "Cross-shard transactions"
      - "Operational complexity"
```

### 2. Database Types and Use Cases

Select the right database for your workload:

```yaml
database_types:
  relational:
    examples: ["PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "Aurora"]
    use_cases:
      - "ACID transactions"
      - "Complex queries"
      - "Data consistency"
    best_for: "OLTP workloads, financial systems"
  
  document:
    examples: ["MongoDB", "DynamoDB", "Couchbase"]
    use_cases:
      - "Flexible schema"
      - "JSON-like data"
      - "Horizontal scaling"
    best_for: "Content management, user profiles"
  
  key_value:
    examples: ["Redis", "DynamoDB", "Memcached"]
    use_cases:
      - "Caching"
      - "Session storage"
      - "Real-time data"
    best_for: "High-performance applications, caching"
  
  time_series:
    examples: ["InfluxDB", "TimescaleDB", "OpenTSDB"]
    use_cases:
      - "IoT data"
      - "Monitoring metrics"
      - "Financial time series"
    best_for: "Time-based data analysis"
```

## Scaling Strategies

### 1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

Increase resources on existing instances:

```yaml
vertical_scaling:
  resources:
    cpu:
      current: "4 vCPUs"
      target: "16 vCPUs"
      cost_impact: "High"
    
    memory:
      current: "16 GB"
      target: "64 GB"
      cost_impact: "High"
    
    storage:
      current: "100 GB"
      target: "1 TB"
      cost_impact: "Medium"
  
  considerations:
    - "Limited by instance maximums"
    - "Downtime required for changes"
    - "Cost increases exponentially"
    - "Single point of failure"
```

### 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

Add more database instances:

```yaml
horizontal_scaling:
  read_replicas:
    configuration:
      - region: "us-east-1"
        instance_type: "db.r5.large"
        purpose: "Primary read replica"
      
      - region: "us-west-2"
        instance_type: "db.r5.large"
        purpose: "Disaster recovery"
      
      - region: "eu-west-1"
        instance_type: "db.r5.large"
        purpose: "Geographic distribution"
  
  sharding:
    strategy: "Hash-based sharding"
    shards:
      - shard_id: "shard-1"
        range: "0-999999"
        instance: "db-shard-1"
      
      - shard_id: "shard-2"
        range: "1000000-1999999"
        instance: "db-shard-2"
      
      - shard_id: "shard-3"
        range: "2000000-2999999"
        instance: "db-shard-3"
```

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategies

Implement comprehensive backup strategies:

```yaml
backup_strategy:
  automated_backups:
    frequency: "Daily"
    retention: "30 days"
    storage: "S3 with lifecycle policies"
    encryption: "AES-256"
  
  manual_snapshots:
    frequency: "Before major changes"
    retention: "1 year"
    storage: "S3 with versioning"
    tags: "environment, application, version"
  
  point_in_time_recovery:
    enabled: true
    retention: "7 days"
    granularity: "5 minutes"
    storage: "Transaction logs"
```

### 2. Disaster Recovery Planning

Plan for worst-case scenarios:

```yaml

  rto_target: "< 4 hours"
  rpo_target: "< 1 hour"
  
  scenarios:
    - name: "Single AZ failure"
      impact: "Medium"
      recovery_time: "15 minutes"
      strategy: "Multi-AZ deployment"
    
    - name: "Region failure"
      impact: "High"
      recovery_time: "2 hours"
      strategy: "Cross-region replication"
    
    - name: "Data corruption"
      impact: "Critical"
      recovery_time: "4 hours"
      strategy: "Point-in-time recovery"
  
  testing:
    frequency: "Quarterly"
    scenarios: "All disaster scenarios"
    documentation: "Required for all tests"
```

## Performance Optimization
