# Getting Started with Kubernetes on Planton.ai

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, and Planton.ai makes it easier than ever to get started. In this tutorial, we'll walk through deploying your first application to a Kubernetes cluster using Planton.ai's platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Planton.ai account
- Basic understanding of containers and Docker
- Your application code ready for deployment

## Step 1: Connect Your Kubernetes Cluster

The first step is to connect your existing Kubernetes cluster to Planton.ai:

1. Navigate to the **Infra Hub** in your Planton.ai dashboard
2. Click **Add Infrastructure**
3. Select **Kubernetes** as your infrastructure type
4. Provide your cluster credentials

## Step 2: Create a Deployment Configuration

Once your cluster is connected, you'll need to create a deployment configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

## Step 3: Deploy Your Application

With your configuration ready, deployment is just a few clicks away:

1. Go to **Service Hub** in your dashboard
2. Click **New Service**
3. Upload your deployment configuration
4. Click **Deploy**

## Step 4: Monitor Your Deployment

Planton.ai provides real-time monitoring of your deployments:

- View deployment status in real-time
- Monitor resource usage
- Check application logs
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow:

- Always use resource limits and requests
- Implement health checks
- Use rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
- Monitor your applications continuously

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed your first application, you can:

- Set up continuous deployment pipelines
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Implement auto-scaling policies
- Explore advanced Kubernetes features

## Conclusion

Getting started with Kubernetes on Planton.ai is straightforward and powerful. The platform abstracts away much of the complexity while giving you full control over your deployments.
