# Terraform Security Best Practices

Terraform security has revolutionized how we secure infrastructure. This tutorial covers essential best practices for building production-ready secure infrastructure that is compliant, efficient, and maintainable.

## What You'll Learn

- Security policy design
- Compliance frameworks
- Access control patterns
- Audit logging
- Production deployment strategies

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Terraform
- Terraform installed locally
- Planton.ai account for deployment
- Knowledge of your security stack

## Step 1: Design Your Security Policies

Start with a well-structured security configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-secure-bucket"
  
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Implement Access Controls

Use proper IAM policies and security groups:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "s3_access" {
  name = "s3-access-policy"
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject"
        ]
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
