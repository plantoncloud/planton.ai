### The Challenge: Inconsistent Multi-Cloud Deployments

**Description:**

Deploying applications across multiple cloud providers often leads to inconsistent experiences due to varying tools, APIs, and deployment processes. Developers grapple with steep learning curves and inefficiencies as they adapt to each provider's unique systems, resulting in delays and increased complexity.

**Visualization Notes:**

- An illustration showing fragmented paths leading to different clouds, each with its own set of tools and icons.
- Depict developers looking confused or overwhelmed by the multitude of different deployment methods.

### Introducing Project Planton: Your Unified Deployment Framework

**Description:**

**Project Planton** offers a consistent, standardized approach to deploying cloud-native applications across any cloud provider. By abstracting the complexities and providing a unified API, it simplifies multi-cloud deployments, reduces learning curves, and enhances developer productivity.

**Visualization Notes:**

- A central hub labeled "Project Planton" with seamless connections to various cloud provider icons.
- Developers happily interacting with Project Planton, with smooth lines leading to different clouds.

### Standardized APIs Inspired by Kubernetes Resource Model

**Description:**

Leverage familiar API structures inspired by the Kubernetes Resource Model for defining deployment configurations. Project Planton's APIs use Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for language-agnostic SDKs, ensuring consistent and validated configurations across all environments.

**Visualization Notes:**

- Side-by-side comparison of Kubernetes YAML definitions and Project Planton's manifest files, highlighting similarities.
- Visual elements like code blocks or configuration files showing standardized structures.

### Default Deployment Modules Powered by Pulumi

**Description:**

Utilize default Pulumi modules that serve as ready-made deployment recipes for common components. While the detailed Pulumi modules are covered on a separate page, Project Planton provides the framework to use these modules effectively, streamlining your deployment processes.

**Visualization Notes:**

- An image of building blocks or modules stacking together to form infrastructure, symbolizing reusability.
- Code snippets showing Pulumi modules being referenced in configurations, with a note to "Learn More" about Pulumi modules.

### Simplify Deployments with the Project Planton CLI

**Description:**

The **Project Planton CLI** acts as your deployment "chef," orchestrating the entire process. With simple commands, validate configurations and manage deploymentsâ€”all through a consistent and intuitive interface.

**Visualization Notes:**

- Terminal window showcasing the CLI commands with successful deployment messages.
- An illustration of a chef icon (representing the CLI) coordinating various ingredients (configurations) to produce a final dish (deployed application).

### Deploy Across Clouds in Three Simple Steps

**Description:**

Follow these straightforward steps to deploy your applications consistently across any cloud provider using Project Planton.

---

**Step 1:** **Define Your Deployment Configuration**

Create a manifest file using the standardized API definitions to specify your deployment components and configurations.

**Visualization Notes:**

- An editor window where a developer is writing a YAML or JSON configuration file.
- Highlighted syntax emphasizing simplicity and clarity.

---

**Step 2:** **Validate Your Configuration**

Use the Project Planton CLI to validate your manifest against the API definitions, ensuring all parameters are correct before deployment.

**Visualization Notes:**

- Terminal showing the validation command (`project-planton validate --manifest your-config.yaml`) with a success message.
- Icons representing error checks, such as checkmarks or green lights.

---

**Step 3:** **Execute the Deployment**

Run the deployment command with the Project Planton CLI, which orchestrates Pulumi modules to deploy your resources seamlessly across the chosen cloud providers.

**Visualization Notes:**

- Terminal displaying the deployment command and progress indicators showing resource provisioning.
- Animation of servers or cloud icons appearing, representing resources being created.
