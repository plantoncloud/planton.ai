This Cookie Policy explains how Buf Technologies, Inc. (**“Buf Technologies”**, **“we”**, **“us”** or **“our”**) uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with the [https://buf.build/](https://buf.build/) website and any other website that we own or control and which posts or links to this Cookie Policy (collectively, the **“Sites”**), and any other mobile applications that we own or control and which posts or links to this Cookie Policy (collectively, the **“Apps”**).

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.

Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).

We use two broad categories of cookies:

1.  first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and
2.  third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.

## What types of cookies and similar tracking technologies does Buf Technologies use on the Sites?

On the Sites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies in the following categories described in the table below.

| _Essential_ | These cookies are necessary to allow the technical operation of our Service (e.g., they enable you to move around on a website and to use its features). | [Buf](https://buf.build/resources/privacy) | See ‘your choices’ below. |

## Other technologies

In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology and pixel tags to collect information automatically.

#### Browser Web Storage

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

#### Web Beacons

We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

## Your choices

Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Sites may not work properly.

For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/). If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Sites.

For more information about how we collect, use and share your information, see our [Privacy Policy](https://buf.build/resources/privacy).

## Changes

Information about the cookies we use may be updated from time to time, so please check back on a regular basis for any changes.
