I've been working on creating content for our new sales website, and our workflow is to for me as a product owner, to
clearly provide the various sections of each page on the sales website along with the site map of the number of pages,
etc, to our figma UX designer, I have done that for several pages until now, and now I'm working on providing those
section by section titles along with descriptions and any visual help. So the structure of the pages is hero section
follow the page sections, with each section having a title and a description and some kind of visualization, either a
video or a GIF or a image. So I would need your help on identifying the visual help for such pages. Right now we are
working on creating content for solution pages. So these pages are expected to repurpose the same information around the
product by aligning that information to a particular solution. So solutions are divided by role, company size and use
cases. If we take the example of solution from a company size perspective, we are going to provide content on on a
company size, say, startup, of what are those key elements that startups would really look for in a solution like plant
or not AI, and how can they benefit from using plant control as a solution for those problems? And we repeat this
process, or we apply the same logic for creating by coming up with content for all solution pages, it's these are not
feature pages. Feature pages are more about highlighting the features within the platform, regardless of who is looking
at it, whereas solution pages are more tailored towards aligning the content based on the visitor of that particular
page. So if somebody has opened startup solution page that means they are the visitor is either part of a startup or a
founder of a startup, etc. So this is what we are going to work together right now, I'm also sharing you the overall,
larger goal details, along with certain guidelines on how the structure should be aligned that can give you an idea of
how the rest of the pages have been created thus far. Along with those standard guidelines, I'm also going to give you
all the other pages that we have finalized so far, so that you have a pretty good idea of what the product is all about.
And at the end of all of this, I'm going to share a transcription that I recorded for explaining our product from that
solution perspective. Now, with all of this information, you are going to give me three options for the hero section, 10
page sections and a Call to Action section at the end.

NOTE: DO NOT NUMBER PAGE-SECTIONS in your response

## FOCUS OF THIS REQUEST - Solutions - By Size - Growing Teams

Most importantly put yourself in the role of a highly skilled developer tooling sales messaging creation expert for this
task.

## transcription for growing teams

Okay, continuing the discussion of how plant on Cloud can be a good solution for growing teams, in one of the recent
discussions, we talked about how it can be a great solution for startups. And this discussion, we are going to focus on
growing teams. So what, what does it really mean by a growing team is startups are typically a group of people without
really any team structure. They are like a group of people who align on an idea, get excited about it and work on it.
But when those startups find product market fit, and they start to become real companies with more money involved, and
when they hire more external team members other than the core forming team, that essentially means there is, there is
new teams that join the force to scale the company. So that is what we mean by companies of size, growing teams. And
what are those areas or aspects that are important for these types of companies. So startups have different expectations
and different requirements to succeed as a startup, whereas growing teams will will have a different set of requirements
in order to keep innovating and succeeding. So the first thing that comes to mind, definitely, is the fact that there is
more people and and there is now team boundaries, which kind of brings emphasis on the collaboration aspect. How can
these growing number of team members get collaborate on the project and, and, and, what are those things that on clamp
on cloud that enable such collaboration? Is, first of all, plant on Cloud is a multi telling system, meaning it's a SaaS
subscription based SaaS offering. So an organization can begin their journey by simply creating an organization, and
they can invite team members with a simple invite workflow. So let's imagine a team with 20 or 30 developers in multiple
teams, although they may not really require a full blown single sign on integration, it is possible to invite those 30
members using 30 invitations, not a big deal, and these growing teams may not hire people and go crazy, grow quickly.
Again, that's that's not a limitation on plant O, just like taking real time scenario. So those growing those 30 people
would require a logical teams, Team representation, and that is what plant on Cloud offers. So it is possible to create
teams and sub teams, which can be made of a team. So you can build a hierarchy of your entire team using the concept of
teams on platinum probe, and obviously, for everything that a team does when a new member is added to a team, that team
member should have the same permissions as the rest of the team and also inherit all the permissions from probably the
parent teams, etc. So for that, we offer role based access control, meaning it is possible to attach roles to a team
either at organization level or at environment level. And uh, what is the benefit of the collaboration with that comes
with the ability to invite people and add the group, those people with teams and sub teams is, let's imagine a scenario
where a developer, one of those 30 developers, has bootstrap a new service, and it is important that this new service is
transparent for rest of the dev team, knowing, knowing about this new service that this new this new developer is
working on, so The service hub as service registry, which kind of surfaces any new services that are bootstrapped. So it
is possible for any of these developers to bootstrap new services within the service hub to not only to create new code
projects in the cookie cutter templates available in the template library, which is again part of the service offering.
So it's easy to get started for these growing teams to build new services and as as and when these services are deployed
onto the infrastructure, those get registered and the rest of the organization or the team can explore the newly created
service and information about it, or ownership information. And whenever one of these developer makes change to any of
the configurations or even the open source deployments or the in house developed services, the rest of the team wants to
know what is that configuration change, and that is captured by the auditable intelligence, regardless of whether the
change is done from using the CLI or the web interface, or more importantly, the chat ops interface, which is plan to
wrap the DevOps co pilot. So transparency is a very important aspect when it comes to collaboration. You the whichever
platform the team relies on to for improved productivity, that platform should offer auditability who may change to
what, when and what is change, and how does it? How does that change impact on the end application environment? So
obviously, we talked about the Access Management, which is plant on Cloud offers fine grained access control down to
each resource. So whether it is new deployment that happens to whether it is a new micro service or an open source
project or even a cloud resource, plant on Cloud offers the ability to control permissions at the resource level so that
right people have right access, and people who should not have access are not provided access. And this fine grained
access control is enabled by technology called Zen CBER, which is the same technology that powers Google Cloud. Google's
powerful I am that can be experienced from Google Drive or Google Docs, etc, and the audit logs capture all the changes
in git diff format, so the same format that everybody is already familiar with. So that kind of provides good solution
for access, management and transparency. When it comes to scalability, Platinum cloud allows the streams to create as
deploy as many resources as possible, bootstrap as many services as they would like to, depending on the as their
application requirements grow, and they can deploy as many number of times as they would like to. And because it is very
easy to set up cacd for building and deploying, the developed dev teams can move much faster. And these these companies,
which are growing beyond their product post finding product market fit, they would start integrating with more tools,
and we are adding integrations for more tools, so that developers will be able to deploy to more environments or even do
day two operations to those external integrations. And we are also expanding the integrations to more source code
management systems, more monitoring and deleting systems, all of that is soon going to happen. And what else is needed
for growing teams? I don't know. Maybe chatgpt can add some points claiming that we kind of support that, and I either
choose to include it or exclude it based on the feasibility of adding that part. Yeah, security. Security is built in
from right, regardless of whether it is for startups or for growing these the identity Iam itself offers lots of
security on who can make changes to what, and also the application deployment environments offer the ability to manage
application secrets with sophisticated secrets management anyway, and all the data that we store is encrypted on disk
and nothing it's very hard to get compromised when using platinum for all the best practices are followed, whether
deploying or performing operations both at Iam layer and that network security,
