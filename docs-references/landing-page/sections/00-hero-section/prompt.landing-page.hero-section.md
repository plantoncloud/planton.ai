Okay, now we are going to just focus on the hero section. That's all, nothing else. So for hero section, I'm thinking,
while the product can be described in any number of ways, there is that one line that kind of sets it sets this product
apart from anything else. And considering that the industry is heavily favoring any solution that is built using
artificial intelligence, I would like to make that to be the face of this product, and to that effect, I want to have
the main title on the hero section as

"Conversational DevOps is the Future. The Future is here".

Now. I'm looking at github.com and it says on the hero section, along with the main title, it says,

"build and ship software on a single collaborative platform"

Because we are a new product to the market, and because we are setting a gold standard for internal developer platform
category, I want to highlight that we are setting the gold standard for internal developer platform, right on the hero
section as a sub section below the main title.

Please proceed with giving me the content for hero-section that I can share with my UX designer who is going to add this
hero-section to the landing page on figma.

Also provide visual help for the UX designer to add some visual elements to the hero section.
