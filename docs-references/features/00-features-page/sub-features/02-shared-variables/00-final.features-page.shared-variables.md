## Section 1: Reducing Configuration Duplication in Microservices**

*Description:*

In cloud-native applications, microservices often rely on identical configuration settings, such as API endpoints or
third-party service credentials. Traditionally, each service maintains its own copy of these configurations within its
codebase, leading to duplication and increased maintenance efforts. For example, services like payments and transfers
might each store the same SendGrid email configuration separately. This scattered approach complicates updates and
increases the risk of inconsistencies when configuration changes are required.

*Visual Help:*

- **Illustration:** Display multiple microservices (e.g., Payments Service, Transfers Service) with identical
  configuration blocks inside each, highlighting the redundancy.
- **Comparison Image:** Side-by-side code snippets from two services showing the same hard-coded configuration values,
  emphasizing duplication.

## Section 2: Centralized Configuration Management with ConfigMaps**

*Description:*

Planton Cloud introduces ConfigMapsâ€”a centralized resource for managing shared environment variables across multiple
services. ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs, allowing services to reference them
without embedding the actual values in their codebases. During deployment, Planton Cloud replaces these references with
the actual configuration values, ensuring consistency and simplifying the deployment process. This method eliminates the
need for hard-coded configurations and reduces duplication across repositories.

*Visual Help:*

- **Diagram:** Illustrate a central ConfigMap connected to several microservices, showing how each service accesses
  shared configuration from a single source.
- **Flowchart:** Depict the deployment pipeline where services reference the ConfigMap, and Planton Cloud injects the
  actual values during deployment.

## Section 3: Simplified Maintenance and Enhanced Scalability**

*Description:*

By centralizing configuration data with ConfigMaps, updating configuration values becomes more efficient. A change made
to a ConfigMap automatically applies to all dependent services upon redeployment, without the need to modify individual
codebases. This approach streamlines maintenance tasks and scales effectively as the number of services and team members
grows. It reduces the risk of configuration drift and saves development time, allowing teams to focus on delivering
features rather than managing configurations.

*Visual Help:*

- **Visualization:** Show a single update in the ConfigMap propagating to multiple services during deployment.
- **Graphical Representation:** A chart comparing maintenance effort over time between traditional duplicated
  configurations and centralized ConfigMaps, highlighting the efficiency gained.
