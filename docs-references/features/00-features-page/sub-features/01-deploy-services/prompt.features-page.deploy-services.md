## Overall Goal

Okay, so I have been working on providing content for the web pages on our new sales website, planton.ai, and the
content will be provided for each page along with the entire page tree to my UX designer, who is skilled in figma, I
have already shared the entire page tree, which which was inspired from github.com page structuring. So essentially,
GitHub has divided their website content or pages into two primary categories. One, there will be dedicated page for
pages for the primary features. Then, there will be dedicated pages for each of the solutions. They also divided their
list of solutions for which github.com is a great product into three primary categories. They are solution by company
size, solution by use case, solution by industry, the solution by use case are DevOps, devsecops, etc. Solution by
company size are startups, growing companies and enterprises. Industries are healthcare, automobile, etc. When it comes
to features, the primary features that they have highlighted are co pilot, GitHub issues, GitHub project management,
Code Spaces, etc. So these, these are what GitHub wanted to know about them. For the visitors of github.com they have
structured the entire website around these items, so as soon as you land on github.com landing page, what you are going
to find is the landing page will include one small section for each of the primary features, followed by one small
section for the solution category. Each solution itself does not have section, but there will be section for each of the
solution categories. So that will be the landing page, and there will be breadcrumbs for each of the from each of those
sections to the dedicated pages for each of the features and each of the solution within the category. So there is
github.com and then there is github.com/solutions which is another page that essentially gives a brief introduction for
each of the solutions. And then there is github.com/features/the feature name. For example, github.com/features/copilot
is a dedicated page to explain copilot. And similarly, there is a dedicated page for each of the primary feature there
is also github.com/features page. Now what is interesting is github.com/features page does not actually talk about any
of these primary features. Github.com/features page is a full page which has a header at the top of that page a sub
header, it's not the main header, a sub header that provides a bread crumb to each of these primary features. However,
the rest of the content on this github.com/features page contains secondary list of features that are not primary
features on github.com com. I have already shared the finalized content for each of the primary feature pages. So the
one last page that I need to work with to provide the content for is github.com/features, page. So as you may have
already understood by now, this page essentially contains secondary features on our own platform. Now I have already
identified a list of such sub features within our platform. I wrote them down, I recorded various transcriptions
explaining each of these sub features. So now I am going to work with you, and I am going to provide one of such sub
feature, and you're going to give me two separate sections with titles, descriptions and any visual help that you can
provide that will help my UX designer to add those sections to the website.

## Problem Statement

Okay, so in today's technology companies where software is being developed, the software development as a concept has
become so complex, and the reason for the that is because the software development has moved from, or moved from
traditional data centers to cloud, and now with the exploration of AI tools, the overall number of tools that developers
are trying to leverage in order to put together a nice software working software, has gotten so complex, and This
probably is more severe as the company goes beyond a startup and starts to grow and expand their teams, and the problem
is far more see like apparent in larger organizations, even for startups going to market depends on how quickly the
software development can be done, and we are going to talk about a few bottlenecks in this whole process of software
development. So in most tech companies, regardless of their size, there will be some kind of an engineering leader. And
in a lot of tech startups, this will be the founder or co founder itself, right? And in like in growing companies, there
will be a CTO, or there may be a director of engineering, whatever so. And then there will be an architect or a senior
software engineer, Senior Software Engineer, and there is a chance that in startups, the founders are the founder or co
founder will also play this role, if it is a tech company, and the founders from a tech background, but you and these
architects of senior engineers will design this system, not just the initial design. They iteratively design the
software as it as it evolves, right and and in modern software development, this design is composed of several small
components, and these small components are called microservices. Now the organizations will have a group of developers.
If it is a startup, it can be it can range from one to five developers. And these developers do back end, they do front
end, they do mobile, etc. And these developers, they develop these micro services, as per the design. And these micro
services, the design also includes, not just the microservices, but the design will also require some third party open
source software. So TP osis examples could be Redis, post, press, etc. So these are, like popular open source
infrastructure that is most commonly found in any any design today, so these micro services directly depend on these
third party and again, moving in the transition to cloud, the design now also takes advantage of several of the managed
services that are provided by major pro providers or companies like Atlas for providing highly managed MongoDB or
confluent for highly managed Kafka or snowflake for its own databases, etc. So there are several managed services, and
then there are third party softwares that are not managed by anyone. So the organization which wants to manage or take
advantage of these open source they need to manage. The management includes deployment operations, etc. Now to help once
the system is developed, the system, in order for the software to be made available to those end users, it needs to be
deployed, right? And the deployment requires deployment of microservices, deployment of these open source and creation
of the managed services on the cloud providers, etc. So to help the developers take care of the process of deploying,
also during the deployment in modern software, these micro service components are built iteratively, right? So
iteratively, as in, small portion of the service gets developed, so small piece gets developed, and then it needs to be
pushed to GitHub so that rest of the team can take advantage of or understand the small modification done to a small
microservice, or a system can be composed of several microservices. So as developers contribute small changes to each of
these microservices, they an iteration is considered complete when that small. Change is published to GitHub and is also
deployed onto lower environment called demo environment. So this requires CICD, which has been around for a long time,
but that's that plays crucial role in this iterative development. As developers collaborate and start pushing tiny
changes, they the CICD is primarily of two steps, which is a bit automation, and then test automation and then
deployment automation. So three core tenants of SCD, so to help developers who are skilled at developing microservices
and to help them take care of the CAC part and finally deploying it on to the end infrastructure. The end infrastructure
is also required to be set up so the third another part of the organization comes into play, which is DevOps. Now these
developers and DevOps, they collaborate very actively during the whole process. And unfortunately, what is happening in
modern software companies is that every time a developer, developer requires something from the DevOps team, even for
most commonly used task, whether it be whether it is CICD or whether it is deploying of this third party open source
software because they need they need that as a dependency in their services, or the creation of any managed services
every time a developer interacts with another DevOps engineer. There are three ways people do do that, depending on the
maturity level of the automation implementation within organizations. One is ticket ops, and then another one is a part
semi partial self service via documentation or reusable TerraForm modules. And the fourth one is full self service
powered by portals built by platform engineers, right? So now, what is this maturity level? How is it different? Is if
it is ticket ops, let's say a developer wanting to deploy something, he creates a ticket and waits on the DevOps team
member. So if and remember, notice that each developer depends on the DevOps engineer, and someone takes their as the
number of developers grow, the number of developers, depending on DevOps engineers, will start to multiply, right? So
let's say the developer waits for the DevOps engineer to take a look at his request and fulfill the request, until then,
the developer gets blocked. So this is where the time is getting lost. Time spending waiting for the help from DevOps
engineers. And there is also more problems we'll talk about later, but this is the core problem that we are trying to
get. So the time spent inventing is the time spent lost in innovating or making productivity and eventually slows down
the feature delivery, and eventually it fits the revenue you you get behind the computation as organization suffers from
this time waiting at by several developers at ensemble DevOps Engineers, that leads to slower feature there will be that
leads to slower that basically makes the organization fall behind in the competition, and that eventually affects
revenue. It is probably slightly difficult to quantify how much revenue is lost because of this, because the amount of
time that gets wasted in these approach where is from situation to situation. Now, platform engineering is a concept
that is aiming to solve this bottleneck of this waiting so each everywhere there is waiting involved, platform
engineering is trying to hit that directly by building this, these Self Service portals that help developers to not
depend on DevOps engineers, where DevOps engineers or platform engineers create the automation, but also make it as a
self service usable with the concept of tea cops. Okay, so I think there is so much traction right now for platform
engineering and plant on cloud. The product that we have built is essentially a self service DevOps platform that works
out of the box so organizations can sign up and they can experience the Self Service DevOps like as if they had hired a
very high expertise platform engineering team, which has built a sophisticated portal for them. And another important
difference between other self service options that are available in the market versus plant and road is introducing yet
another portal for these developers. Is basically saying, hey, learn this one more tool and. That kind of probably is
very frustrated, more friction within the organization. So that's where we took advantage of conversational DevOps
powered by AI. So what this means is, imagine you have a instead of a portal, you have a chat chat bot that essentially
makes you that is 24 by seven available, which is equally capable as a platform engineer and understands your request in
natural language. Say, for example, you need a third party software deployed on Kubernetes. You can simply ask the
asking your conversation and natural language saying, hey, Redis deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, and this
conversation chatbot, it is, if it is capable of fulfilling your request on demand, right? When you need it, that's it.
That's amazing, right? Like, developers don't really need to learn new interfaces, etc. So that is one of the biggest
differences between plant upload, which is powered by AI, enables conversational DevOps. Concluding all of this plant on
Cloud, we think conversational DevOps is the future, and the future is here because plankton.ai now has fully
functioning conversational chat bot that can provide lots of lots of support for developers to develop their software
much faster, because they can get what they want Using those conversational interfaces right in the chat. However, there
is, as for bigger organizations, things done within the chat bot that kind of kills the transparency is a deal breaker,
because as the teams grow, there is a there will be a necessity to have transparent actions taken all over. So in case
of ticket ops, the transparency is enabled by the very nature of ticket ops. There are tickets, there is information
associated with who created ticket, who kind of served the ticket, mean who worked on the ticket, which is typically the
DevOps engineer. So there is so much information, and what are the steps taken during the ticket? And if any automation
has been executed for this ticket, they are associated with some GitHub actions, etc. And so there is so much governance
and administration there. And if somebody is asking for something like ticket, if the requester is not authorized to
request for it, then the whole system, there will be comments left by the engineer denying because of lack of
authorization. So now, how does this transition over in case of self services, whichever self service system that the
organization is deploying to take care of this bottleneck that kind of wastes device precious development time, should
also take take care of enabling transparency and only performing the operations on authorization. So governance and
administration and transparency are key. So for to support all of that, regardless of what operations are performed in
the conversational chatbot, everything is surfaced as part of the optical intelligence where every configuration change
is captured as a git diff and is and the whole history of configuration changes is available on as a Version History
against each of the several components that are that make up this entire software, and for every change that is made to
the configuration, if it is related to a deployment, whether it is a micro service deployment or a third party OSS
deployment, or to Kubernetes or other infrastructure, or whether it is a managed a component that is created on a
managed service. All of the configuration changes are deployed using pulumi modules. So in Planck road chat bot, so the
pulumi module stack job, we call them a stack job. So stack jobs, even though those are created as part of the
conversational chat stacks, those captured as stack jobs history. Every stack job is preserved, whether it is created
from conversation, chapter or outside, and that enables provides lots of governance and auditability, because every
change captured as version history also has a corresponding stack job. And there will be a way for anyone to take a look
at how the configuration change impacted the infrastructure, because the pulumi operations persisted on the platform
also persist all the diffs produced by pulumi CMI. And so that is the problem that we are trying to solve. So with plant
on cloud. So as we are trying to build the sales website and trying to build the messaging portion to position plant on
Cloud as a rock solid solution for to solve this bottleneck, we are, we are constantly iterating, and I think at this
point it's safe to say that the positioning or the title that we, I am very comfortable with, is conversational DevOps
is the future. Future is here. So I am hoping that with this explanation, I can get more help from either any AI tool or
anyone who is experienced in building compelling sales messages. If they understand this narrative and can help me
create content on the sales website.

## Intro Video Script

I am also sharing here a draft of a script that I wrote to create an introductory video for the product which many give
you more information about the problem space.

### Script

The world of software development has gotten so complex in today's cloud native.

but fortunately, a consistency has evolved.

organizations building technology products have architects/senior engineers who design the system and in most cases
these architectures are composed of various tiny components called as microservices. organizations hire software
developers who then start developing these microservices. these microservices are developed iteratively. each iteration
to complete required continuous integration. build and deployment automations enable efficient and quick iterations.

these microservices also depend on third party open source software, managed cloud services. finally all these
components need to be deployed somewhere. that is where the operations team steps in to help developers. these
operations teams are incharge of the cloud services that provide nuts and bolts i.e compute, network and storage
required to run these microservices, third-party services and managed cloud-services.

problems:

- build and deployment automations - historically, ops teams took care of these automations. but now, developers are
  responsible for these automations i.e shift left.
- every time a developers is waiting for the ops team, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is digging through the documentation to identify the ownership of a service that their service
  depends on, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to deploy their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to scale their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to monitor their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to secure their service, it is a waste of time.
- every time a developer is trying to figure out how to troubleshoot their service in remote environment, it is a waste
  of time.

end result:

unhappy developers, lost productivity, unhappy customers, lost revenue.

solution:

- developers should be able to deploy their service on their own.
- developers should be able to scale their service on their own.
- developers should be able to monitor their service on their own.
- developers should be able to secure their service on their own.
- developers should be able to troubleshoot their service in remote environment on their own.
- developers should be able to do all of the above without having to dig through the documentation.
- developers should be able to do all of the above without having to wait for the ops team.

# MESSAGE 2

Here is a transcription from one of the videos I recorded explaining a sub-feature of our platform: Deploy Services

```
Okay, so to remove the burden of operations, burden, which is the case with shift left moment that's happening, meaning
the devs are being burdened with the stuff that they don't really enjoy doing much, which is operations. And operations
is begins with like taking care of setting up, taking care of the build process, deployment process and post deployment,
which is usually like setting up monitoring and alerting, etc, etc. So devs, when tasks, when they're burdened with the
all of these various operations, they tend to be less productive and less happy. So in an effort to help the developers
feel less of this operations burden, one of the key areas that we have planned on Cloud has innovated so much is around
the concept of application deployments. I know that there are like tons and tons of applications or like services out
there, which claim to simplify application deployments radically. And I would say, since this is a necessity more than
like a groundbreaking innovation I am, I would like to simply ensure that the chatgpt provided with all of the input, it
kind of makes the obvious clear to the end users, that is when they choose plant on Cloud, they can they are assured
that quantum cloud also provides a very streamlined and consistent approach for deploying up their applications. So
these applications are of different types. They can be web apps, they can be back end APIs. They can be cron jobs. They
can be like functions, etc, etc. So 111, aspect of plantain cloud that sets us apart in terms of the deployment
experience that developers get is each of these categories of applications, depending on where they are deployed, the
type of configuration that the developer needs to think about, care about will vary, like, for example, if the web app
is being deployed on an easy to instance, without the use of Docker image, then the developer has to deal with certain
inputs. If the developer is trying to deploy it on easy to as a Docker image, then the developer needs figure out the
Docker industry, and how the, how does the image gets pulled, etc, and if the same way back when deployed onto
Kubernetes, the developer may have to figure out things like, what should be the resource allocation, what should be the
namespace it gets deployed to, and how do I, how can, how will, how Will the environment variables be configured for
that on Kubernetes, etc, the same web app can also be deployed onto service like fargate, which is a lightweight version
of Kubernetes. Again, the options available here are different. For example, on Kubernetes, Kubernetes offers ingress
management, whereas fargate doesn't. So depending on the type of application and the platform or the environment on
which it is going to eventually be deployed onto, developers really have to deal with their own unique combinations. So
the area where plant on Cloud sales for application deployments is we plant on Cloud has taken these popular
combinations of the type of application with the type of target environments on which they are going to be deployed. And
API resource have been modeled for these combinations. Like, for example, when a micro service is deployed onto
Kubernetes, it is modeled as micro service Kubernetes, and the specification written in protobuf language for this
combination focuses on the inputs that a developer would care about or is can provide for this combination when
deploying micro services on Kubernetes, similarly, micro service on fargate is another API resource model, which for
which the specification only includes the attributes or configuration options available for the developers when
deploying microservice on fargate. And similarly, if the microservice is deployed on Cloud, run which is a GCP service,
the same specification contains the options only available for cloud. Now this kind of presents a consistent pattern,
right? So depending on the choice of the environment that the developer wants to deploy, they can it is very easy for
them to understand the corresponding inputs that are needed. So this is basically this enables more white glove
experience for developers, regardless of what they are trying to deploy and where they are trying to deploy, versus
generic solutions that do not provide this kind of kind to provider mapped API resource modeling. So that is where
planton cloud really shines, and we want to highlight that in the context of application deployments and one other
area. And this deployment framework, via model, via these API resources, takes care of providing good support for
injecting environment variables or environment secrets and and take also takes care of ingress management, wherever
possible, etc, and resource allocation. So all, all those basic but necessary aspects are very well defined in these API
specifications that allow developers to kind of specify them and during their deployment. However, while these API
resources are a way for developers to provide uh or configure their deployment. Now, how would plan on Cloud make it
easy for developers to co locate this configuration within their Git repositories? So when I say git repositories, each
uh component, for example, if it is a web app which is next case app, it is usually a git repository with the dot next
files in it, etc, etc. And it may also have a Docker file which is required for taking care of the build part of the
automation. And now, when it comes to providing a consistent experience for developers to provide the configuration
needed, we recommend not enforce, but recommend customized as a choice of tool and with base and overlays. Okay, so
let's imagine the target and environment for deploying this web application is micro service on Kubernetes, so the
customized base will have a micro service dot AML that contains the API specification for kind of micro service
Kubernetes, and it contains a spec part as Well, but the spec part may contain environment variables and secrets and
resource allocations. However, this specification is going to be different, meaning some of the environment variables
are common across all the environments. Some of the resource allocation can be defined at a base layer and only
overridden at production layer, etc. So the overlays aspect of customize helps us provide a streamlined experience,
because customize is a popular, open source, well maintained, well documented tool, we didn't want to create another
abstraction for developers to learn about. We simply resorted to the most popular tool, as long as the developers are
able to understand the specification required for the chosen combination of application, workload type to target
environment, then co locating in the configuration in their git report repositories is as simple as creating a
customized directory with base and overlay directories, where base contains the API specification in YAML format for the
resource, while overlays will allow the developers to overlay like for example, overlay may have a file called a folder
called prod overlay, which contains micro service dot YAML with specific only the attributes in the spec, like resources
spec dot container resources with overridden or the resources that are more relevant for production. So now it is
possible to use just the customized tool to create the final configuration when deploying it to the appropriate
environment. All of these details are something that planton cloud provides more experience in the form of GitHub
actions and GitHub workflows. So if there is a Docker file and inside the project, Platinum cloud offers pre built
GitHub actions to build a Docker image from the Docker file and publish it to the artifact registries, whichever that
can be. And there are GitHub actions that provide deploy by taking advantage of the contents of the customized directory
and overriding some of the attributes from command line as part of GitHub actions like, for example, when a new commit
is published, a document gets pushed and with the commit ID to the registry and the GitHub action created for deploying
based on the contents of the customized directory. The plant on CLI will allow the developers to override by using
hyphen, hyphen set and provide the image tag to the GitHub commit ID, thereby creating a final API resource spec which
further simplify and the next step of deployment is simply to apply that manifest to plan term cloud and plan down cloud
immediately triggers a stack job that takes this modified, Modified Object and The live progress of the pulumi workflow
to take this YAML manifest gets, gets the application deployed onto the target environment. And this experience is
consistent regardless of whether the application is being deployed on the fargate Kubernetes cloud run, etc. So the the
highest value that developers gain here is from the consistency and well documented API specifications for these various
types of workloads, for deploying applications. 
```

Now you will give me three sections that clearly explain the "Deploy Services/Apps" feature in a way that any developer
building services can easily understand the value proposition being offered here. Keep the sections close to the real
world examples that developers developing apps in cloud-native stack can relate to.

for each section, give me title, description, visual help for what to record in the form of video, or screenshots or
gifs or whatever you think is appropriate.

IMPORTANT: YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN BUILDING SALES MESSAGING AND POSITIONING AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO CRAFT THE SALES FEATURES
PAGE CONTENT TO TELL A COMPELLING NARRATIVE. ALSO REMEMBER THAT AS THE VISITOR SCROLLS DOWN THE FEATURES PAGE, THEY
SHOULD GET A FEELING OF A STORY BEING TOLD INSTEAD OF DISJOINTED FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS.

* THE DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE CONCISE AND SHORT
* DO NOT USE GRAND LANGUAGE ON THIS PAGE "REVOLUTIONARY" etc. Use simple
language since these are secondary feature sections aimed at educating about those feature but not exaggerate.

* IF THE STORY CAN NOT BE TOLD WITH A SINGLE SHORT DESCRIPTION ADD MULTIPLE SHORT DESCRIPTIONS THAT THE UX DESIGNER CAN DIVIDE INTO CARDS LIKE SECTIONS.

* I also shared github.com/features page as reference so that you are careful in crafting the content at appropriate length.

* AVOID USING TERMS LIKE "YOU". Always use Passive voice.

* Add comparisons with status quo methods to make the value proposition clear.

FINALLY: TAKE YOUR TIME. THINK AS HARD AS YOU CAN AND GIVE ME THE BEST POSSIBLE SALES MESSAGE IN RELATABLE LANGUAGE SINCE WE ARE
A NEW PRODUCT ENTERING INTO THE MARKET AND DO NOT WANT TO CONFUSE VISITORS WITH LANGUAGE THAT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
DONT TAKE IT EASY.
