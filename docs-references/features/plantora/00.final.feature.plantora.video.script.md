## 1) WHITEBOARD OR SIMPLE INTRO (0:00 – 0:20)
   
What You’ll Do On Camera / Whiteboard

Stand or sit in front of a whiteboard (or just your desk/camera).
Keep it casual—like you’re explaining to a colleague, not pitching a product in a commercial.

Draw a quick, simple diagram: a box labeled “DevOps tasks,” an arrow, and then “Plantora Chat.”

### Example Devops tasks:

* Create a database
* Update configuration of an existing database
* Deploy a microservice on an environment

Suggested Talking Points

“Hi, I’m <Name>. I’m going to show you how we handle everyday DevOps tasks with Plantora—using just a chat interface.
We’ll spin up some cloud resources, and let Plantora handle the heavy lifting.”

## 2) SCREEN RECORDING: PROVISIONING DEMO (0:20 – 1:20)
   What You’ll Show

Your web browser logged into Plantora.
You initiating a new chat with Plantora (the “Ask Plantora” interface) and typing a simple request.

### Step-by-Step Actions

* Open the Plantora Console
* Show how you click “Ask Plantora” or whichever button starts the chat.
* Type a Request 
  * For example: “I need a AWS Dynamodb Table for our staging environment.”
* Bot Prompts for Details
* Let the viewer see how Plantora asks for environment or config details.
  Following is the prompt that we would get from Plantora:
```
  To proceed with creating the AWS DynamoDB table, I need to collect the mandatory fields as per the specification. Please
  provide the following information:

  1. Name of the Resource: What would you like to name this DynamoDB table?
  2. Environment Name: You've mentioned this is for the staging environment, so I'll use "staging" unless you specify
  otherwise.
  3. Table Name: What is the name of the table you want to create?
  4. Hash Key:
    • Name: What is the name of the hash key?
    • Type: What is the type of the hash key? (Valid values are 'S', 'N', 'B')


  Once I have this information, I can proceed with the creation process.
```
* Type following details in the chat
```text
Table name is user-sessions
Hash Key Name is session-id
Hash Key Type is S
name is user-sessions
environment name is staging
```
* Let the viewer see how Plantora shows the final state of the resource and asks for You Confirmation
* Quickly type “Yes, proceed.”
* Show Real-Time Progress with the help of the stack job logs that got triggered immediately

* Optional: Briefly open AWS platform console to verify the resource is there.

* Suggested Voiceover or Live Narration 
  “Here’s how easy it is to create an Aws Dynamodb with Plantora. I type in what I need, Plantora asks for a few settings, and once I confirm, it does the provisioning in the background. No manual scripts, no complicated dashboards.”

## 3) SCREEN RECORDING: COLLABORATION DEMO (1:20 – 2:00)
   What You’ll Show

How to share the chat or the resource with a teammate so they can see everything in real time.
Step-by-Step Actions

* Open the Same Chat (the one you just used to create Aws Dynamo Db).
* Click “Share Chat” or “Invite Team,” whichever the UI offers.
* Invite a Colleague
  Type the teammate’s name or add an entire team.

* Split-Screen 
  If you want, show a second browser logged in as the colleague so the viewer sees the chat pop up for them.

* The colleague can type, “add attribute email of type S” and confirm.

Plantora Applies the Update
Show the chat completing that update.

Suggested Voiceover or Live Narration

“Now, I need to collaborate with a teammate to add additional attributes to the dynamo db. Instead of dumping logs into Slack to share the progress, I just share this exact chat. My teammate sees everything instantly and can modify settings right from here. Plantora handles the requests in context. Collaboration without confusion.”

## 4) QUICK WRAP-UP (2:00 – 2:20)
   What You’ll Do

Return to your face or a final whiteboard shot.
Summarize the benefit in 1–2 sentences.
Suggested Talking Points

“That’s the basic idea behind Plantora’s conversation-driven DevOps. You say what you need, share as needed, and Plantora does the busywork—securely and without extra overhead.
Thanks for watching!”
