          Absolutely! You’re free to switch from Free to Plus or from Plus to Pro whenever it suits
          you.

          If you’re already on a paid Pro plan, you can move down to Plus,
          but the transition will happen once your current billing period ends. This ensures you
          still get full Pro features for the remainder of your billing cycle, and then you’ll
          automatically switch to Plus.

          Yes! PlantonCloud is entirely free for K–12 classes, homeschool groups, and higher

          Definitely. PlantonCloud is one of the few solutions offering a single, capped-price
          option that covers unlimited users. We believe in straightforward, predictable pricing—no

          Nope! Our Free plan and all free trials do not require credit card details. If you switch
          to a paid tier with a trial, you’ll only be asked for a credit card when the trial wraps
          up—if you decide you want to keep going. You’re in complete control.

          No. Because we don’t request your payment information for the trial, there’s no way to
          bill you unless you decide to continue and provide a card yourself. Once the trial ends,
          if you’re happy with PlantonCloud and want to stick around, you can enter your credit card
          then. If not, no action is required.
